## 1. ADVENTURE OVERVIEW

**Neon Replicant** is a full campaign adventure for Starfinder Second Edition spanning ten levels. Players take the role of street-level operatives in Axiom City, a sprawling megacity controlled by three megacorporations. Over four acts, the party unravels a conspiracy involving synthetic humanoids (called **Echoes**) who are developing genuine sapience — and the corp that wants to destroy them before the truth gets out.

**Themes:** Identity, humanity, corporate exploitation, memory, free will, the line between organic and constructed life.

**Tone:** Neo-noir. Rain-soaked streets. Neon advertisements for products the characters will never afford. Violence is real and has costs. Moral choices rarely have clean answers.

**Player Character Hooks:** All players should have a reason to be in Axiom City's lower districts. Suggested backgrounds: Bounty Hunter, Street Urchin, Ex-Corp Security, Junk Dealer, Underground Medic, Fixer, or Rogue Programmer.

---

## 2. SETTING: AXIOM CITY

Axiom City floats in perpetual smog above a flooded continental shelf. The megacity is vertically stratified:

### The Spire (Levels 80–200)
The uppermost tiers house the three megacorporations and their executive class. Clean air. Private security. Biometric everything. Player characters will rarely visit here before Act Three. Security level: Extreme. Random checks every block.

### The Mesh (Levels 20–79)
Middle districts: corporate middle management, licensed entertainment, body-mod parlors, licensed restaurants, surveillance cameras every 10 feet. Passable living conditions. Security level: High.

### The Drain (Levels 1–19)
The bottom of the city. Rain never evaporates here. Neon signs advertise things no one can buy. The three corps maintain only skeleton security because the Drain enforces its own order. The player characters start here. Security level: Minimal (gang-controlled).

### The Undercity (Below Level 1)
Flooded sub-basements and abandoned infrastructure. Home to the most desperate, off-grid hackers, illegal chop-shops, and the Echoes who have gone fully rogue. No corp presence. Extremely dangerous.

### The DataSphere
Axiom City's omnipresent AR/VR network. Every corporate citizen has a DataSphere implant from birth. Drain residents buy black-market knockoffs or steal deprecated corporate hardware. The DataSphere can be hacked, navigated, and fought in — treat it as a second city existing in the same space.

---

## 3. FACTIONS & MAJOR NPCs

### The Three Megacorps

**AXIOM INDUSTRIES** — The original founders of the city. They control water, atmosphere processing, and structural engineering. Their security forces are the Axiom Wardens (AW), blue-and-white armored soldiers. CEO: **Director Calla Voss** (human woman, 70s, augmented to appear 40, ruthless pragmatist).

**KRONOS BIOTECH** — Medical, biological augmentation, food production. They created the Echo program. Their enforcers are called **Renewal Agents** — sleek, polished, disturbingly calm. CEO: **Prefect Dain Morel** (android, immaculate, and deeply unsettling).

**RED ORACLE** — Information, surveillance, entertainment, weapons. They know everything. Their street-level agents are called **Queries** and wear red visor masks. CEO: **Ink** (anonymous; possibly a distributed AI, possibly a collective of humans — no one knows).

### Key NPCs

**VERA-7** (she/her) — An Echo (synthetic humanoid) who has escaped Kronos containment. She is the adventure's emotional core. Vera-7 has developed genuine memories, preferences, and fear of death. She looks entirely human but her blood is bioluminescent blue. She initially distrusts the party but becomes an invaluable ally. She is searching for her "cohort" — the other Echoes from her batch who were scheduled for retirement (termination).

**ROOK** (he/him) — The party's fixer. A heavyset human man with a chrome jaw, three arms (one augmented), and a genuinely warm laugh. He operates out of a bar called The Substrata in the Drain. He gives the party their initial jobs and escalates their involvement. He has a secret: he knew the lead engineer on the Echo project.

**DETECTIVE SABLE INES** (she/her) — A homicide investigator for the Axiom Wardens who is not entirely corrupt. She is investigating a string of "retirement" murders that have been attributed to gang violence. She and the party are initially at cross-purposes but share a common enemy. She has prosthetic eyes that record everything she sees — she can't turn them off.

**MIRROR** (they/them) — A legendary DataSphere hacker who communicates only through text and avatar. Mirror has been watching the Echo situation for years and has archives that could bring down Kronos. They are also an Echo who has lived entirely inside the DataSphere for three years. Their body is in a tank somewhere in the Undercity.

**UNIT 0** (it/its) — A Kronos Biotech "Shepherd" — a military-grade Echo built specifically to hunt other Echoes. Unit 0 is the primary recurring antagonist. It is meticulous, tireless, and almost impossible to kill. Over the course of the adventure, evidence emerges that Unit 0 is also developing genuine consciousness — and it is horrified by what it's been made to do.

**PREFECT DAIN MOREL** — The KRONOS CEO and final villain. Morel is an android who achieved legal personhood through a landmark court case twenty years ago. He now runs a program that denies that same personhood to Echoes. The party's confrontation with this hypocrisy is the moral climax of Act Four.

---

## 4. ADVENTURE BACKGROUND

Fifteen years ago, Kronos Biotech launched the **Echo Program**: the production of synthetic humanoids indistinguishable from organic life for sale as servants, laborers, soldiers, and companions. Legally, Echoes are property. They have a built-in four-year lifespan controlled by a biological timer in their brainstem. When the timer expires, they shut down. This is called "retirement."

What Kronos did not anticipate: in the third generation of Echoes (the "Triad Series"), the neural architecture became complex enough that genuine sapience emerged. Not simulated emotion — real fear, real love, real desire to live. Kronos discovered this eighteen months ago.

Rather than acknowledge it, Prefect Morel ordered all Triad Series Echoes retired early and classified the data. But 23 Echoes escaped before the shutdown order was executed. They've been hiding in the Drain and Undercity. Kronos sent Unit 0 to find and retire them — quietly.

The adventure begins when a Triad Series Echo named VERA-7 staggers into Rook's bar with a Kronos retrieval team two minutes behind her.

---

## 5. ACT ONE: MEAT (LEVELS 1–3)

*"You're not important enough to have enemies. That's about to change."*

### Scene 1-1: The Substrata (Opening)

**Setup:** The party is at Rook's bar, The Substrata. Read or paraphrase:

> *The Substrata smells like recycled air and cheap synth-beer. Rook is behind the bar, his chrome jaw catching the neon from the sign outside. It's raining — it's always raining. Then the door blows open and a woman stumbles in, soaking wet, one hand pressed to a wound in her side that glows faintly blue. Behind her, through the rain, you can see three figures in white-and-grey corporate uniforms raising weapons.*

**What happens:** Rook immediately shouts for the party to get the woman down and get the door closed. A firefight erupts — three **Kronos Retrieval Agents** (see Monster Stats) force their way in. The party must repel them.

**Encounter:** 3 Kronos Retrieval Agents (Level 1 enemies). This is an introductory combat meant to establish tone and get blood pumping. The agents use nonlethal if possible — they want Vera-7 alive.

**After the fight:** Vera-7 is injured but stable. Rook patches her wound (the bioluminescent blue blood unsettles anyone who sees it). She is terrified and initially refuses to explain who she is. A DC 15 Diplomacy or Medicine check reveals the wound is not biological — there's a micro-mesh of synthetic fiber beneath her skin.

**Development:** Rook pulls the party aside. He knows what she is. He asks the party to take her somewhere safe and find out what she knows. He pays 200 credits each and promises more. This is the inciting job.

### Scene 1-2: Running the Drain

**Setup:** The party must move Vera-7 through the Drain to a safe house while Kronos Wardens sweep the district.

**Skill Challenge: Urban Evasion**
The party must accumulate 6 successes before 3 failures to navigate through the district undetected.

- **Stealth (DC 13):** Move through alleys and maintenance tunnels.
- **Society (DC 12):** Know which gang controls which block and navigate their territory with permission.
- **Deception (DC 14):** Talk past a Warden checkpoint.
- **Athletics (DC 13):** Cross a flooded underpass by climbing the maintenance gantries above.
- **DataSphere Hack (Computers, DC 15):** Loop a surveillance camera.

**Success:** The party reaches the safe house without additional combat.
**Failure (3 failures):** A **Kronos Patrol** (2 Retrieval Agents + 1 Shepherd Drone) catches up. Fight and run.

### Scene 1-3: First Words

**Setup:** At the safe house (an abandoned maintenance depot in Level 4 of the Drain), Vera-7 begins to trust the party. This scene is primarily roleplay.

**What Vera-7 reveals (in stages, based on party approach):**
- She is a Triad Series Echo, Batch 7, Unit 7 (hence the name she chose for herself).
- She has a four-year timer. It has 11 months remaining.
- Three weeks ago, Kronos began retiring all Triad Series Echoes ahead of schedule. She doesn't know why.
- She knows of 22 others like her. Most are in hiding. Some may already be dead.
- She has a fragmented data packet she extracted from a Kronos facility before she ran. She can't decrypt it herself — she needs a DataSphere specialist.

**DC 14 Perception:** Vera-7 has a small scar behind her left ear — a data port, inactive. The party may not know what it's for yet.

**Key RP moment:** Vera-7 asks the party a direct question: *"Do you think I'm real? Not synthetic — real. Like you."* How the party responds shapes her trust going forward.

### Scene 1-4: The Chop Job

**Setup:** Rook identifies a DataSphere specialist who can decrypt Vera-7's data: a black-market hacker named **Spit** who operates out of a chop-shop called the Grinder in Level 9.

**The Grinder** is run by the **Rust Saints** gang. The party must negotiate access (Diplomacy DC 15, or pay 500 credits, or do a favor — the Saints need a Kronos surveillance drone recovered from a rival gang's territory).

**Optional Side Encounter:** If the party does the drone-recovery job, they fight 4 **Rust Saint Rivals** (Level 2 enemies) and discover the drone contains footage of Unit 0 executing an Echo in a back alley — their first glimpse of the primary antagonist.

**At the Grinder:** Spit (a frenetic teenager with six DataSphere rigs running simultaneously) agrees to decrypt the data. It takes 48 hours. While they wait, advance to Act One's climax.

### Scene 1-5: The Retirement Notice

**Setup:** Word reaches the party that one of the Triad Series Echoes Vera-7 mentioned — a male Echo named **CALIX-3** — has been found by Unit 0. He is hiding in the Undercity. Vera-7 begs the party to help him.

**Encounter: Unit 0's First Appearance**
The party descends into the Undercity (flooded tunnels, bioluminescent fungus, salvaged lighting). They find Calix-3 barricaded in an old pump station. Unit 0 is cutting through the door.

**Unit 0** does not attack the party immediately. It analyzes them. It states, flatly: *"You are interfering with a legitimate corporate retrieval operation. Stand aside or be classified as assets for recovery."*

This is NOT a fight the party can win at Level 1-2. The goal is to grab Calix-3 and run.

**Chase Encounter:** The party flees through the Undercity with Calix-3 while Unit 0 pursues. Use a simplified Chase mechanic — three rounds, each requiring a DC 14 Athletics, Acrobatics, or relevant skill check to maintain the lead. If they fall behind, Unit 0 catches up for one round of combat before they escape through a route too flooded for Unit 0 to follow.

**Act One Conclusion:** The party returns to find Spit has decrypted Vera-7's data. The packet contains partial schematics, employee communications, and one critical file: a Kronos internal memo from Prefect Morel confirming that the company knows the Triad Series is sapient. The reason for early retirement is buried in an encrypted secondary file that requires higher-level DataSphere access to unlock.

**XP and Advancement:** Party reaches Level 3.

---

## 6. ACT TWO: GHOST (LEVELS 4–6)

*"Everything you remember might be borrowed. The question is whether it matters."*

### Overview

Act Two expands the scope. The party now knows the broad shape of the conspiracy but needs evidence strong enough to go public — or leverage. They make contact with Mirror, infiltrate a Kronos data vault, and learn the full truth about the Echo program. Vera-7 begins to question her own memories as she realizes some of them may be implanted.

### Scene 2-1: The Broker

**Setup:** Rook connects the party with a Red Oracle information broker named **Tessla** who operates from a private suite in the Mesh. Tessla has no loyalty to Kronos and a professional interest in any information that could shift the corporate balance of power.

Tessla offers the party a deal: she will provide DataSphere access credentials for the Kronos Medical Archives in exchange for a copy of whatever the party finds. She also mentions that someone called Mirror has been asking about Triad Series Echoes.

**Skill Challenge: Negotiation**
Tessla is sharp and the party must succeed on 3 social skill checks (Diplomacy, Deception, or Intimidation, DC 16) to get favorable terms. On a failure, they still get the credentials but Tessla also secretly sells their identities to a Red Oracle Query team — foreshadowing trouble later.

### Scene 2-2: The DataSphere Dive

**Setup:** Using Tessla's credentials, one or more party members can enter a deep DataSphere session to access the Kronos Medical Archives. This is a non-physical infiltration — the characters jack in (literally or via headset) and navigate the DataSphere representation of the archive.

**The DataSphere Archive** is represented as a vast brutalist building made of white light and sliding data panels. It is protected by ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Entities) — represented as abstract geometric entities.

**Encounter A: Security ICE** — 3 Security Constructs (Level 4). These are DataSphere-native entities. Characters fighting in the DataSphere use their normal stats but damage taken here manifests as system shock (characters who are "killed" in the DataSphere are ejected and stunned for 10 minutes).

**Finding the Files:**
- A DC 17 Computers check locates the secondary encrypted file from Vera-7's data packet.
- A DC 15 Medicine check finds the full Triad Series development logs.
- A DC 18 Computers check locates something unexpected: footage of the Echoes in development — learning, laughing, forming friendships. Watching it is deeply affecting. Anyone who views it must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or gain the Shaken condition for 1 hour.

**What the files reveal:**
The Triad Series did not develop sapience by accident. It was the deliberate work of a lead engineer named **Dr. Asha Rinn**, who believed she was creating genuinely conscious beings and documented everything. When Morel discovered what she'd done, she disappeared. Official records say she resigned. The party suspects otherwise.

### Scene 2-3: Mirror

**Setup:** After the DataSphere dive, the party receives a text message on a device they've never registered: *"You found what I found. We should talk. —Mirror"*

Mirror communicates through an AR projection — a shifting figure that never resolves into a clear face. The conversation is guarded and initially tense.

**What Mirror reveals:**
- Mirror is a Triad Series Echo (Batch 4, Unit 12). They have been living in the DataSphere for three years, their physical body maintained by automated systems in the Undercity.
- Mirror has been compiling evidence for two years but lacks the physical-world reach to do anything with it.
- They know where Dr. Asha Rinn is — she was detained by Kronos in a medical facility in the Mesh, listed as a "patient" in a ward that doesn't appear on any public manifest.
- Mirror also warns: *"Unit 0 is different from other Shepherds. It asked me a question once, before I escaped. It asked me if I was afraid. I said yes. It said nothing. It let me go. I don't know why."*

### Scene 2-4: Finding Dr. Rinn

**Setup:** Dr. Rinn is held in the **Kronos Restorative Care Wing**, Level 34 of the Mesh. It operates as a legitimate medical facility on its public floors — the detention ward is sub-floor 2, accessible only through staff credentials or physical infiltration.

**Approach Options:**
- **Stealth infiltration:** Sneak in through the service entrance, disable cameras (DC 18 Computers), neutralize or avoid 4 **Kronos Medical Wardens** (Level 4).
- **Social infiltration:** Forge credentials (DC 17 Deception + DC 16 Society) and walk in as medical consultants.
- **Brute force:** Fight their way in. This alerts the entire facility and Axiom Wardens respond in 6 rounds.

**Dr. Rinn:** A woman in her late 50s, thin and haunted. She has been here for fourteen months. She is lucid but deeply traumatized. She cooperates immediately with anyone who mentions the Echoes.

**What Dr. Rinn gives the party:** A physical data drive (analog, unhackable, pre-DataSphere technology) containing the complete Triad Series sapience documentation, authenticated with her biometric signature. This is legally admissible evidence. It is the most valuable object in the adventure.

**Complication:** As the party leaves, they discover Detective Sable Ines is in the building — she was following a different thread and arrived at the same location. She has just figured out that Kronos is behind the "gang violence" Echo murders. Do the party trust her? She has the power to give them legal cover but she also has corporate obligations.

### Scene 2-5: The Memory Question

**Setup:** Between scenes, a quiet moment with Vera-7. She has been researching herself and has found something disturbing in the files from the Kronos archive: her earliest "memories" — her childhood, her parents, her hometown — are implanted fabrications. Standard practice for Echoes sold as companions. She never had parents. She was activated eighteen months ago.

**This scene is pure roleplay.** Vera-7 is in crisis. The party must engage with her grief and crisis of identity.

**Key questions the scene should raise (not answer):**
- Does a memory need to be real to matter?
- Is identity built from what you remember, or from what you do?
- Is Vera-7 less real because her origins were constructed?

**Mechanical note:** If the party supports Vera-7 meaningfully, she gains a permanent bonus: +1 to all saves vs. fear effects for the remainder of the adventure. If the party dismisses her distress, she becomes Withdrawn (a roleplay condition affecting future social interactions with her).

**Act Two Climax: The Query Team**

If Tessla sold the party's identities (see Scene 2-1 failure), three **Red Oracle Query Agents** (Level 6) attack the party's safe house in the night. They want the data drive, not lives — but they'll take lives if necessary.

This is also when **Unit 0** reappears. It arrives during or immediately after the Query ambush — not to fight the party, but to retrieve something it claims Vera-7 is "carrying without authorization." After a tense standoff, it leaves without violence if the party does not escalate. Vera-7 afterward says: *"It looked at me like it was trying to remember something."*

**XP and Advancement:** Party reaches Level 6.

---

## 7. ACT THREE: SHELL (LEVELS 7–8)

*"The higher you go, the colder it gets. The corps built it that way on purpose."*

### Overview

The party now has the evidence. Act Three is about what to do with it. They must navigate competing power brokers, survive a corporate assassination attempt, and make a choice that will define the ending: go public, sell the data, use it as leverage, or try to free the remaining Echoes directly.

### Scene 3-1: The Value of Truth

**Setup:** The party must decide what to do with Dr. Rinn's data drive. Options:

**A) Give it to Detective Ines** — She can use it to open a formal investigation, but this is slow (months) and Kronos will work to bury it or discredit Dr. Rinn. The party gets legal protection but uncertain results.

**B) Sell it to Red Oracle (Ink)** — Ink will pay enormously (50,000 credits each) and will use it as leverage against Kronos in the corporate power game. The Echoes become bargaining chips rather than people. Vera-7 will not forgive this.

**C) Give it to Mirror for public DataSphere broadcast** — Instant public exposure. Kronos cannot contain it. But the corp will retaliate against everyone connected to the leak, and the legal status of the Echoes will take years to resolve in court.

**D) Use it to negotiate directly with Morel** — The most dangerous option. Morel will meet, but he will also use the meeting to set a trap.

The GM should present these options without pushing toward one. Each has genuine costs and benefits.

### Scene 3-2: The Remaining Echoes

**Setup:** Vera-7 asks the party to help gather the remaining Triad Series Echoes before Kronos retires them. Mirror has located 14 survivors. The party can mount a rescue operation.

This is a multi-stage **Montage Encounter**: the party organizes and executes three separate extractions across different parts of the city, with a Unit 0 complication in each.

**Extraction 1 — The Mesh (Level 32, posing as a housekeeping staff):** Stealth-heavy. Two Echoes (DOSS-1 and SELA-8) are hiding in a maintenance closet inside a corporate apartment block. 3 Kronos Wardens patrol. Unit 0 is watching the building from outside — it knows the Echoes are there but does not immediately act.

**Extraction 2 — The Drain (known turf):** Faster but dangerous. Five Echoes are sheltering with a gang that has started to demand payment in return for their continued protection. The party must negotiate or fight (4 **Gang Heavies**, Level 7) and get the Echoes out before a Kronos retrieval team (dispatched by the gang leader, who sold the information) arrives.

**Extraction 3 — The Undercity:** The remaining seven Echoes are with Mirror's physical body, deep in the Undercity. Getting there requires navigating flooded tunnels. Unit 0 is here, waiting. But instead of fighting, it stands aside. When challenged, it says only: *"I will not file a report of this contact."* It walks away.

### Scene 3-3: The Spire

**Setup:** If the party chose option D (negotiating with Morel) or option B (Red Oracle), or if any of the other plans require a meeting in the Spire, this scene handles their first visit to the top of Axiom City.

**The Spire is alienating by design.** Everything is clean. The air is noticeably better. Security is everywhere but unobtrusive. The party feels out of place. Morel's offices are on Level 189.

**Meeting with Morel:** He is impeccably polite and entirely without warmth. He acknowledges the party's evidence without flinching. He makes an offer: in exchange for the data drive and their silence, he will extend the timer of every remaining Triad Series Echo by five years and grant them de facto freedom in the Drain. No legal personhood. No rights. But alive.

**This is a trap.** Morel has no intention of honoring the deal — he is buying time for Unit 0 to be upgraded and redeployed. A DC 19 Sense Motive check detects the insincerity. If the party accepts, they receive the deal in writing (which Morel will void on a technicality within 72 hours). If they refuse, Morel activates a hidden security team.

**Encounter:** 2 **Kronos Elite Wardens** + **Shepherd Command Unit** (Level 8 enemies). The party must fight their way out of Level 189 of a corporate tower. Highlight verticality, glass walls overlooking the city, and the terrifying gap between the Spire and the Drain below.

### Scene 3-4: Unit 0's Choice

**Setup:** The party finds Unit 0 waiting for them, alone, outside their current safe house. It has disabled its own tracking beacon.

**Unit 0 speaks more than it ever has.** It says it has been reviewing its mission logs and finds its actions — the retirements it carried out — to be "inconsistent with the function it was built for." It uses neither "I" nor any pronoun to describe itself. It asks the party: *"Is there a word for something that has done harm it cannot undo?"*

This is an optional alliance. Unit 0 will not fight for the party — but it will refuse to fight against them, and it will provide intel on Kronos's next move: a city-wide "sanitation sweep" in the Drain using Axiom Wardens, intended to eliminate all Echoes under the cover of a gang crackdown.

The party must decide whether to trust Unit 0. If they do, it becomes a limited ally in Act Four.

**XP and Advancement:** Party reaches Level 8.

---

## 8. ACT FOUR: SIGNAL (LEVELS 9–10)

*"They built a machine that could be afraid. Then they were surprised when it didn't want to die."*

### Overview

Act Four is the climax. The Kronos sanitation sweep is imminent. The party must stop it (or ensure the Echoes survive it) and bring Morel to account. This act involves a major battle, a final confrontation, and a choice that defines the adventure's ending.

### Scene 4-1: The Sweep

**Setup:** The party has 24 hours before the Axiom Wardens move into the Drain. They have gathered most of the Echoes in one location (Mirror's Undercity station or a location of the party's choosing). They must prepare.

**Preparation Phase (Skill Challenge):**
The party organizes defenses and prepares contingencies. They have 6 preparation slots to fill from the following options:

- Fortify the location (Athletics/Engineering, DC 18): +2 to all defenses during the battle.
- Recruit gang allies (Diplomacy, DC 17): 8 **Rust Saints** fight alongside the party.
- Set DataSphere traps (Computers, DC 19): Disable one wave of enemies automatically.
- Broadcast the evidence early (Computers, DC 16): Rally public sympathy; Kronos pulls 2 enemy squads to manage PR.
- Get Detective Ines into position (Diplomacy, DC 17): She arrives with 4 Axiom Warden defectors.
- Prepare evacuation route (Survival/Society, DC 16): Echoes can be evacuated if the battle turns.

**The Battle:**
The sweep comes in three waves over the course of an hour:

**Wave 1:** 8 Axiom Wardens (Level 7) led by a **Warden Captain** (Level 9). Standard police-style assault. The party should hold.

**Wave 2:** 4 Kronos Retrieval Agents + 1 **Retrieval Coordinator** (Level 9) with drone support. Harder. The goal is suppression rather than direct combat.

**Wave 3:** A single **Shepherd Prime** (Level 10 Elite) — a military-grade unit, not Unit 0. If Unit 0 is an ally, it intercepts and engages the Shepherd Prime, buying the party critical time (Unit 0 defeats it but is severely damaged).

### Scene 4-2: The Broadcast

**Setup:** During or after the battle, Mirror activates their plan: a simultaneous broadcast across the entire DataSphere using every Echo's personal testimony — their memories, their fears, their hopes. It runs for 47 seconds before Kronos shuts it down.

47 seconds is enough. The Echoes speak in their own voices to 4 billion people. Whatever the legal outcome, the truth is out.

**Mechanical note:** The broadcast changes the city's response to the Echoes. Going forward, random encounters in the Drain are more likely to be friendly. Red Oracle sells the story to every media outlet they can find. Axiom Industries quietly distances itself from Kronos.

### Scene 4-3: The Prefect

**Setup:** Morel retreats to the Spire. But the party has evidence, public sympathy, and a city that's watching. If they choose to confront him directly, this is the final encounter.

**Getting to Morel:** The Spire is now on lockdown. Options:
- Use Unit 0's access codes (if ally) to navigate internal security.
- Hack their way up through the DataSphere maintenance infrastructure (Mirror assists; DC 20 Computers).
- Detective Ines gets official authorization for a raid (slower but legally clean).
- Direct assault (the most dangerous but most cinematically satisfying option).

**The Final Confrontation:**

Morel is in his office on Level 189. He has two **Kronos Elite Wardens** and one last **Shepherd-class unit**. This is the final combat of the adventure.

**Mid-fight development:** When Morel is reduced to half HP, he makes a final gambit: he attempts to remotely trigger all remaining Triad Series timers, killing every Echo simultaneously. The party must choose — continue fighting Morel, or one or more characters must hack the trigger system (DC 22 Computers) to stop the signal. This creates a split-action finale where the party must manage both threats simultaneously.

**Resolution:**
If the trigger is stopped, the Echoes live. Morel, if captured, faces a legal process that will take years but will likely result in criminal charges. If Morel escapes, he surfaces in a potential sequel hook.

**Vera-7's Ending:** Regardless of the outcome, Vera-7 still has her timer. It now has approximately 8 months remaining. Mirror has been working on a solution — a timer override based on Dr. Rinn's notes — but it's unproven. The adventure ends with this unresolved: hopeful but honest. Life doesn't always have clean endings.

## 10. NEW EQUIPMENT & CYBERNETICS

### Cybernetics (Illegal in Drain without license; widely available on black market)

**Chrome Reflex Weave** (Level 3, 250 credits)
Subdermal mesh augmentation. +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves and initiative. Your skin has a faint metallic sheen under bright light.

**DataSphere Bridge Implant — Black Market Edition** (Level 2, 175 credits)
Allows full DataSphere access without a corporate account. Susceptible to corporate ICE — a DC 15 Computers check is required to avoid detection when accessing restricted nodes. A legitimate version (Level 2, 500 credits) has no detection penalty.

**Synthetic Eye Upgrade — Low-Light** (Level 3, 300 credits)
Replace one or both eyes. Grants low-light vision. Each additional model (darkvision, thermal, telescopic) adds 200 credits and 1 level.

**Pain Editor (Illegal)** (Level 5, 800 credits)
Intercepts pain signals. You are immune to the Sickened condition from pain effects and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves vs. Incapacitation effects. Long-term use: after 30 days, begin making DC 15 Fortitude saves weekly or gain a level of Drained (cumulative, recovering 1 per week of non-use).

**Muscle Lace** (Level 4, 500 credits)
Interwoven synthetic muscle fiber. +1 item bonus to Athletics and a +2 item bonus to damage with melee attacks. Visible as corded muscular definition in bright light.

**Echo Detector** (Kronos-issued, stolen versions available) (Level 5, illegal to possess)
A handheld scanner. As a 2-action activity, scan a target within 10 feet. A DC 18 Perception check vs. the target's Fortitude DC detects the synthetic bio-mesh of an Echo. Kronos Wardens carry these routinely.

### Weapons

**Monofilament Blade** (Level 3, 200 credits)
*One-handed melee weapon, finesse, agile*
Damage: 1d6 slashing | Bulk: L
A blade with a monomolecular edge. On a critical hit, the target's armor bonus is halved for the rest of the encounter (the blade finds gaps).

**Stun Pistol, Corp-Grade** (Level 2, 150 credits)
*One-handed ranged weapon, nonlethal*
Damage: 1d6 electricity (nonlethal) | Range: 30 ft | Bulk: 1
DC 14 Fortitude save on hit or Stunned 1 for 1 round.

A plasma cutter modified for combat. On a critical hit, target catches fire (2d6 persistent fire damage, DC 17 Reflex to extinguish).

**Neural Disruptor** (Level 7, 900 credits)
*One-handed ranged weapon, mind-affecting*
Damage: 3d6 mental | Range: 40 ft | Bulk: 1
On a hit, target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be Confused for 1 round. Ineffective against constructs unless they have a neural architecture (Echoes, Mirror, Unit 0 are all valid targets).

## 11. APPENDIX A: RANDOM ENCOUNTER TABLES

### The Drain (Roll d6, use when traveling between locations)
1. **Kronos Sweep** — 2d4 Retrieval Agents on patrol. They stop and scan for Echoes. If the party is with Vera-7 or other Echoes, roll Stealth vs. their Perception (+7).
2. **Rust Saints** — 1d4 gang members. Roll Diplomacy DC 13: success means they pass without incident; failure means they want a toll (50 credits each or a fight).
3. **Desperate Echo** — A lone Triad Series Echo (not yet encountered) approaches the party for help. Not combat — this is a RP opportunity and potential seed for a side mission.
4. **DataSphere Glitch** — A localized DataSphere malfunction. All implanted characters see confusing AR overlays for 10 minutes. DC 14 Will save or Flat-Footed for 1 round at the start of the next encounter.
5. **Red Oracle Query** — A single Red Oracle Query Agent is following the party. They don't attack — they're gathering information. If confronted: Diplomacy DC 16 to get them to back off, or they escalate to their superiors.
6. **Clear** — No encounter. The party reaches their destination unmolested. For once.

### The Undercity (Roll d6)
1. **Flooded Passage** — A tunnel is more flooded than expected. Athletics DC 15 to cross; failure means 1d6 bludgeoning damage and possible gear damage.
2. **Feral Constructs** — 1d4 abandoned industrial drones, reprogrammed by someone unknown, are hostile to anyone in corporate-adjacent gear. Level 2 construct enemies.
3. **Echo Shelter** — A group of 3 non-Triad Echoes (normal, non-sapient models, legally property) are hiding here from unknown threat. Their timer is expired — they're dying and confused.
4. **Mirror Contact** — Mirror sends a message. A new intel fragment, a warning, or a cryptic piece of Kronos information relevant to current events.
5. **Undercity Salvager** — A human scavenger with useful black-market gear. Roll Diplomacy DC 12; success means they trade. They've seen Unit 0 down here recently.
6. **Structural Instability** — Part of the Undercity shifts. DC 14 Reflex save or take 2d6 bludgeoning from debris. The collapse opens a new passage to somewhere interesting.

## 12. APPENDIX B: AXIOM CITY LOCATIONS

### The Substrata (Drain, Level 3)
Rook's bar. Two floors, sticky surfaces, neon beer signs, a back room with a medical kit and a DataSphere rig. Always has 2d6 patrons. Back exit leads to maintenance alley. Rook's office has a hidden compartment with a loaded scatter pistol and 2,000 credits in emergency funds.

### The Grinder (Drain, Level 9)
Rust Saints chop-shop. Ground floor: vehicle parts and harvested cybernetics. Basement: Spit's DataSphere setup. Security: 4 Rust Saints on rotation, 2 guard dogs (cyborg, with thermal vision). The Saints are neutral-to-friendly if the party has good rep.

### Kronos Medical Annex (Mesh, Level 34)
Eight public floors of legitimate medicine. Sub-floor 1: restricted research. Sub-floor 2: detention ward (12 cells, always guarded by 4 Medical Wardens). Building security office on floor 3. DataSphere junction on floor 1 (basement level) allows network access to the entire building with the right credentials.

### The DataSphere Archive (Virtual Location)
Appears as a brutalist monolith of white light. Three wings: Personnel, Medical, and Research. Each wing has its own ICE (Security Constructs, level appropriate to wing). Research wing is most heavily defended. The architecture shifts when ICE is alerted — DC 17 Perception to track your position after an alarm.

### Mirror's Station (Undercity, Below Level 1)
A former water pumping station, now dry. Mirror's physical body is here in a support tank surrounded by seventeen DataSphere rigs running simultaneously. The station is warded with reprogrammed Kronos drones. Six Triad Series Echoes live here as de facto guardians and companions.

### The Spire, Level 189 — Morel's Office
A corner office with floor-to-ceiling glass. On a clear day (rare), you can see the ocean. The room contains: one large desk, no personal effects, a concealed weapons locker (DC 20 Perception to find), and a direct DataSphere kill switch hardwired to Kronos's Echo timer network. The kill switch is the objective of Scene 4-3.

## 13. APPENDIX C: ADVENTURE HOOKS & SIDE JOBS

These side missions can be run between acts to develop characters, earn resources, and deepen the world.

**Side Job: The Borrowed Life**
A woman in the Drain approaches the party. Her companion — she thought he was human — has just had his timer expire. She knew he was an Echo but believed he had legal personhood. She didn't know about the timer. She wants to know if there was someone she could have sued, blamed, or stopped. There's no combat. Just grief. This exists to humanize the issue.

**Side Job: Corporate Ghost**
A Kronos programmer has been killed and his death staged as a suicide. His sister (a Drain resident) hires the party to find the truth. The programmer was about to whistleblow on the Echo program. Leads back to Morel's office. Evidence adds to the party's dossier. Final encounter: 2 Query Agents who want the evidence destroyed.

**Side Job: Chrome and Steel**
A Mesh-level body modification parlor is offering illegal military-grade augmentation without proper sterilization protocols. People are dying. The parlor is a front for Axiom Industries running unlicensed experiments. The party can shut it down (combat), expose it (evidence), or sell the information to Red Oracle (morally questionable but profitable).

**Side Job: The Last Shepherd**
A non-Triad Echo (a simple, non-sapient labor model) has had its timer expire but continues to function in degraded mode. It keeps showing up to the job it was built for — maintaining a building that burned down years ago. It's not dangerous. People in the Drain have started leaving food for it out of superstition. The party can: document it for Mirror's broadcast, arrange a humane shutdown, or find a way to stabilize its degraded systems (DC 20 Medicine + DC 18 Computers). No combat. Quietly one of the most affecting encounters in the adventure.

**Side Job: The Query's Query**
A Red Oracle Query Agent contacts the party privately, off-record. They're an Echo themselves — a Triad Series model placed inside Red Oracle before the early retirement order. They don't know if Ink knows what they are. They need help. This plants a potential ally inside Red Oracle and raises fascinating questions about Ink's actual nature.

## 14. GM NOTES & TONE GUIDE

### Running the Adventure

**This is a noir story, which means:**
- Information is always partial. The party should feel like they're assembling truth from fragments.
- Every faction has a reason for what it does. Even Morel believes he is making the rational choice.
- Violence has consequences. Kronos tracks casualties. When the party kills Wardens, there are more Wardens the next time. The corps can absorb losses indefinitely; the party cannot.

**The Echoes are people.** If the party starts treating them as objects or tools, have Vera-7 call it out directly. She doesn't need to be angry — she can be tired, or sad, which is worse.

**Unit 0's arc** is intentional. Do not resolve it. Let it remain ambiguous whether Unit 0 has achieved genuine consciousness or is simulating it. The question is more interesting than any answer.

**The timer** on Vera-7 is a ticking clock that the GM should reference organically. Don't announce it. Let it come up in conversation. When she's frightened, she might mention how much time she has left. It should never be far from the players' minds.

### Adapting to Your Table

**For a faster campaign (6–8 sessions):** Compress Acts Two and Three by skipping the Dr. Rinn scene and having Mirror deliver the key information directly. Reduce the rescue Echoes montage to one extraction.

**For a longer campaign (15+ sessions):** Expand the Drain as a living place. Give the Rust Saints more internal politics. Let the party spend time between jobs just living in the world. The horror of corporate dystopia is most effective when characters have things they care about in it.

**For a more action-focused table:** Add additional combat encounters in each act and reduce the number of pure roleplay scenes. Replace the Memory Question scene with a combat where the party defends Vera-7 from an assassin while she processes the revelation.

**For a more character-drama-focused table:** Add sessions dedicated to individual character backstory connections to the Echo issue. Perhaps one player character has an Echo family member. Perhaps one used to work for Kronos.

### The Ending and Its Variations

There is no single correct ending. Here is what each resolution achieves:

**Public Broadcast:** Legally slow but culturally transformative. The party becomes famous — and hunted. Vera-7's timer remains. A sequel is possible: the legal fight for Echo personhood.

**Detective Ines route:** Slower, safer, less dramatic. Morel faces charges eventually. The Echoes live in a legal grey zone for years. The most realistic outcome, and perhaps the most honest.

**Red Oracle route:** The Echoes become leverage. They survive but are not free. Vera-7 never forgives the party. Morally challenging ending that may feel unsatisfying — which is the point.

**Direct confrontation:** The most cinematic. Someone probably dies. Morel may escape. The Echoes are free. Vera-7's timer is unresolved. Best ending for a group that wants to feel the cost of what they've done.

---

### Final Note

*Blade Runner* asks: what does it mean to be human?
*Cyberpunk 2077* asks: what does it mean to be free in a world built to own you?

This adventure asks both questions, and it doesn't answer either one.

The party's job is not to solve the question. It is to be present while Vera-7 lives with it — and to make sure she has enough time to do that living.
