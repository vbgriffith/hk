# DECK 1: XYRIS, THE WRITHING STORM
## "The Wheel That Never Stops Turning"
### Commander: Xyris, the Writhing Storm (Grixis — U/R/G)
### Strategy: Card Draw Engine | Wheel Effects | Snake Token Flood | Group Hug Kills

---

## COMMANDER OVERVIEW

**Xyris, the Writhing Storm** (4UG, Legendary Creature — Snake Leviathan)
- Flying, Haste
- Whenever an opponent draws a card, create a 1/1 green Snake token.
- Whenever Xyris deals combat damage to a player, each player draws that many cards.

The engine is deceptively simple: make everyone draw cards, generate exponential tokens from every card drawn by opponents, then overwhelm the table. Wheel effects are the gas. Xyris is the spark. The snakes are the inferno.

---

## THE 99

### COMMANDER (1)
- Xyris, the Writhing Storm

---

### WHEEL EFFECTS — THE CORE ENGINE (18)
*Each wheel refills your hand AND creates tokens equal to cards drawn by all opponents combined.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Wheel of Fortune | The original. 7 cards drawn by each opponent = 21 tokens minimum with 3 opponents. |
| Windfall | Scales with hand sizes. Late game draw engine. |
| Wheel of Fate | Suspend 4, but free when it resolves. |
| Timetwister | Reserved List bomb. Replace with Echo of Eons if budget. |
| Echo of Eons | Flashback from graveyard — wheel it twice. |
| Reforge the Soul | Miracle cost makes it nearly free. |
| Memory | Expensive but devastates opponents' graveyards too. |
| Magus of the Wheel | Creature-based wheel. Repeatable with flicker. |
| Dragon Mage | Combat damage wheel — synergizes perfectly with Xyris. |
| Teferi's Puzzle Box | Every opponent draws every upkeep. Continuous token generation. |
| Forced Fruition | Opponents draw 7 whenever they cast a spell. Devastating. |
| Howling Mine | Symmetric draw each upkeep. Fuels Xyris passively. |
| Font of Mythos | Draw 2 for everyone each upkeep. |
| Prosperity | X for everyone. Pay 10, make 30+ tokens. |
| Skyscribing | Forecast mechanic = repeatable draw each upkeep. |
| Minds Aglow | Join Forces wheel — opponents may pay in but you get all the tokens. |
| Whispering Madness | Cipher onto Xyris; wheels every time Xyris hits. |
| Xyris's own trigger | Xyris hits → everyone draws → triggers more snake creation. |

---

### TOKEN AMPLIFIERS (12)
*Multiply or empower the snake tokens Xyris creates.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Doubling Season | All tokens enter doubled. Non-negotiable include. |
| Parallel Lives | Second doubling effect for tokens. Stacks with Doubling Season. |
| Primal Vigor | Third doubling — may help opponents too, but you create far more. |
| Anointed Procession | A fourth doubling effect (white in multicolor deck via Ramos? No — Xyris is Grixis. Skip.) |
| Intruder Alarm | Every token ETB untaps all creatures. Enables infinite loops. |
| Earthcraft | Tap tokens for mana — tokens become a mana battery. |
| Cryptolith Rite | Tap any creature for mana of any color. |
| Craterhoof Behemoth | The alpha strike finisher. One swing with 30 snakes ends games. |
| Beastmaster Ascension | Gives all creatures +5/+5 after 7 attacks. Easily triggered. |
| Coat of Arms | Each snake gets +N/+N for each other snake. Scales insanely. |
| Shared Animosity | Snakes boost each other on attack. |
| Overwhelming Stampede | Give all creatures trample and +X/+X equal to your biggest creature. |

---

### CARD DRAW SUPPORT (10)
*Additional draw beyond wheels to keep the engine running.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Sylvan Library | Top 3 each draw step; pay life to draw more. |
| Rhystic Study | Tax everyone or draw every spell they cast. |
| Mystic Remora | Early game draw engine disguised as group hug. |
| Curiosity | Enchant Xyris: deal damage → draw a card → more tokens. |
| Ophidian Eye | Same as Curiosity but can be used on any creature. |
| Coastal Piracy | Draw whenever any of your creatures deal combat damage. |
| Reconnaissance Mission | Cycling backup for Coastal Piracy. |
| Edric, Spymaster of Trest | Opponents draw when their creatures connect — but so do you for each snake. |
| Guardian Project | Draw when unique creatures ETB. |
| The Locust God | Each card drawn creates a Insect token; backup engine. |

---

### MANA BASE & ACCELERATION (14)

---

### PROTECTION & INTERACTION (10)
*Keep Xyris alive and protect your turns.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Lightning Greaves | Shroud + Haste. Xyris has haste already — shroud is the value. |
| Swiftfoot Boots | Hexproof + Haste. |
| Cyclonic Rift | The best blue removal spell in EDH. |
| Deflecting Swat | Free redirect for commander — protects Xyris with no mana. |
| Fierce Guardianship | Free counterspell when you control your commander. |

| Pongify | Instant-speed removal for 1 mana. |

| Heroic Intervention | Board wipe protection for your token army. |

---

### COMBO LINES (5 cards each facilitating at least one combo)

| Card | Combo |
|------|-------|
| Intruder Alarm + Earthcraft | Every token untaps all creatures → tap for mana → cast wheel → more tokens → loop |
| Xyris + Whispering Madness | Cipher on Xyris: deal damage → wheel → draw → tokens → deal damage → repeat |
| Forced Fruition + any draw spell | Opponents draw 7 each spell → 21 tokens per spell cast at the table |
| Teferi's Puzzle Box + Doubling Season + Parallel Lives | Each upkeep: everyone draws 1 and discards hand → 4–8 tokens per opponent per turn |
| The Locust God + Wheel | Wheel draws 7 → 7 Insects + 7-per-opponent Snakes in a single cast |

---

## GAME PLAN

**Turns 1–3:** Deploy mana rocks and draw engines (Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora). Get Xyris out by Turn 4 at latest.

**Turns 4–6:** Cast Xyris. Begin wheeling. Each wheel with 3 opponents and 7 cards drawn = 21 tokens minimum. With Doubling Season in play, that's 42 tokens per wheel.

**Turns 6–8:** Attack with Xyris (unblocked via Rogue's Passage or evasion). Each combat damage trigger draws cards for everyone → more tokens. Cast Forced Fruition to make opponent spells catastrophically expensive in tokens.

**Win condition:** Overwhelm with tokens pumped by Coat of Arms, Beastmaster Ascension, or Craterhoof Behemoth. Alternatively, grind opponents out of cards via repeated wheeling.

# DECK 2: VARINA, LICH QUEEN
## "The Undead Tide"
### Commander: Varina, Lich Queen (Esper — W/U/B)
### Strategy: Zombie Tribal | Draw Engine | Token Flood | Discard-to-Resource Conversion

---

## COMMANDER OVERVIEW

**Varina, Lich Queen** (1WUB, Legendary Creature — Zombie Wizard)
- Whenever you attack with one or more Zombies, draw that many cards, then discard that many cards. You also gain that much life.
- Pay 2, exile two cards from your graveyard: Create a 2/2 black Zombie token.

Varina is a self-sustaining engine. Attack with Zombies → draw cards → fill your graveyard → exile graveyard cards to make more Zombies → attack with more Zombies → draw more cards. The deck builds momentum every combat step until opponents can't keep up.

---

## THE 99

### COMMANDER (1)
- Varina, Lich Queen

### ZOMBIE TRIBAL — CORE CREATURES (22)
*Every zombie serves a purpose. No vanity picks.*

| Card | Role |
|------|------|

| Shepherd of Rot | Tap: each player loses 1 life per Zombie you control. Repeatable drain. |
| Plague Belcher | Sac a Zombie: deal 1 damage to any target. Sacrifice outlet. |
| Liliana's Mastery | +1/+1 to all Zombies; create two 2/2 tokens. Anthem + bodies. |

| Gleaming Overseer | Menace + ward to token Zombies. Protects your horde. |
| Champion of the Perished | +1/+1 counter per Zombie ETB. Gets enormous fast. |

---

### INFINITE COMBOS

**Combo 1: Gravecrawler + Rooftop Storm + Phyrexian Altar**
Gravecrawler costs 0 (Rooftop Storm). Sacrifice it to Phyrexian Altar → 1 black mana. Cast Gravecrawler from graveyard for free. Repeat infinitely. Each loop triggers: Undead Augur (draw), Vengeful Dead (drain), Shepherd of Rot (drain), Syr Konrad (damage). Win on the spot.

**Combo 2: Gravecrawler + Rooftop Storm + Cryptbreaker**
Cast Gravecrawler infinite times with Rooftop Storm and a sac outlet. Each cast triggers Diregraf Colossus for tokens. Tap 3 Zombies to Cryptbreaker repeatedly: draw your deck.

**Combo 3: Varina + Necropotence + Zombie horde**
Necropotence fills your hand (7 cards, lose 7 life). Varina's attack trigger replaces that life. Attack with 10 Zombies: draw 10, discard 10, gain 10 life. Discard goes to exile (Necropotence) — use Necromancer's Stockpile before Necropotence closes the window.

---

---

## GAME PLAN

**Turns 1–3:** Deploy lords and draw engines. Cryptbreaker on Turn 1 is ideal. Get a discard outlet ready before Varina hits.

**Turns 4–5:** Cast Varina. Begin attacking with the Zombie horde. Each attack is a draw-7 if you have 7 Zombies. Discard feeds your graveyard; graveyard feeds Varina's activated ability.

**Turns 5–7:** Rooftop Storm makes all Zombies free. Endless Ranks doubles your board each upkeep. Shepherd of Rot drains 1 per Zombie per activation. Call to the Grave kills every non-Zombie. You're immune.

**Win:** Either Gravecrawler combo for infinite drain, or attack with a horde pumped by Coat of Arms for lethal in a single swing.

# DECK 3: NEVINYRRAL, URBORG TYRANT
## "Trigger Happy Apocalypse"
### Commander: Nevinyrral, Urborg Tyrant (Esper — W/U/B)
### Strategy: Triggered Ability Chaining | Death Triggers | Zombie Tokens from Destruction | Recursive Wrath Engine

---

## COMMANDER OVERVIEW

**Nevinyrral, Urborg Tyrant** (5UBB, Legendary Creature — Zombie Wizard)
- When Nevinyrral enters the battlefield, destroy all non-Zombie creatures.
- When Nevinyrral dies, create a 2/2 black Zombie token for each creature destroyed this way.
- Nevinyrral can't be countered.

The strategy: maximize Nevinyrral's triggered abilities by ensuring the first trigger destroys as many creatures as possible, and the second trigger creates a proportional Zombie army. Then use recursion to do it again. And again. And again.

---

## THE 99

### COMMANDER (1)
- Nevinyrral, Urborg Tyrant

---

### MAXIMIZING THE ETB TRIGGER (14)
*More creatures on the board when Nevinyrral enters = more Zombies when he dies.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Forbidden Orchard | Give opponents 1/1 Spirits whenever you tap for mana. Fills their boards before you wipe. |
| Hunted Phantasm | Give each opponent 1/1 Goblins when it ETBs. You get a 4/6; they get fuel for your wipe. |
| Hunted Horror | Give opponent two 3/3 Centaurs. High-power targets for Nevinyrral's wipe. |
| Hunted Lammasu | Give opponent two 4/4 tokens. More wiping fuel. |
| Dowsing Dagger | Give opponent two 0/2 creatures. Sacrifice it after the wipe for mana. |
| Shiny Impetus | Enchant creature; redirect attacks; when it attacks, its controller draws — you want big, juicy, numerous boards. |
| Tempt with Vengeance | X tokens to each player who agrees. All those tokens die to Nevinyrral. |
| Orzhov Advokist | Each upkeep: opponents can add +1/+1 counters to a creature in exchange for not attacking you. Grows their creatures; more for Nevinyrral to kill. |
| Varchild, Betrayer of Kjeldor | Damage creates Survivor tokens under the opponent's control. They die to Nevinyrral. |
| Tombstone Stairwell | Creates Zombie tokens each upkeep (from graveyards) that die at end step — they don't die to Nevinyrral's trigger, but stack graveyards. |
| Illness in the Ranks | Make all opponent tokens 0 power while fueling Nevinyrral kills. |
| Generous Gift | Turn something into a 3/3 Elephant, then Nevinyrral kills it. |
| Reprocess | Sacrifice creatures you don't want; draw cards equal to sacrificed. Clear board before Nevinyrral enters. |
| Sharding Sphinx | Create artifact Thopter tokens, which are also non-Zombie creatures for Nevinyrral to kill and replace with Zombies. |

---

### MAXIMIZING THE DEATH TRIGGER (14)
*Nevinyrral must die to trigger the Zombie creation. Make his death a feature, not a bug.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Ashnod's Altar | Sacrifice Nevinyrral for 2 colorless mana → triggers death → Zombie army → cast him again. |
| Phyrexian Altar | Sacrifice for any one color of mana. More flexible. |
| Viscera Seer | Sacrifice Nevinyrral; scry 1. Free sacrifice outlet. |
| Carrion Feeder | Sacrifice Nevinyrral; Feeder gets a +1/+1 counter. |
| Altar of Dementia | Sacrifice Nevinyrral; mill a player equal to its power (8 power). Mill yourself for recursion fuel. |
| High Market | Tap land: sacrifice a creature. Sacrifice Nevinyrral in response to exile effects. |
| Greater Good | Sacrifice Nevinyrral: draw 8, discard 3. Card advantage before the Zombie trigger resolves. |
| Razaketh, the Foulblooded | Pay 2 life, sacrifice a creature: tutor any card. Use Nevinyrral's death to tutor his resurrection. |
| Nim Deathmantle | Pay 4: regenerate a creature when it dies, equip immediately. Sacrifice Nevinyrral, pay 4: he returns instantly. Use with Ashnod's Altar: two sacrifices pay for the Deathmantle. |
| Mikaeus, the Unhallowed | Gives non-Humans undying. Nevinyrral is a Zombie Wizard — gets undying. Dies → returns with +1/+1 counter → ETB wipe again → dies again → second Zombie army. |
| Conjurer's Closet | End of turn: blink a creature. Blink Nevinyrral → ETB wipe → dies before it resolves? No — blink returns, retriggers ETB. Devastating. |
| Temur Sabertooth | Pay 1G: return Nevinyrral to hand. Bounce to recast; also protects from exile. |
| Erratic Portal | Return target creature to owner's hand: return Nevinyrral to hand, recast. |
| Tortured Existence | Discard Nevinyrral → return another creature. Alternate recursion path. |

---

### ZOMBIE ARMY AMPLIFIERS (10)
*The Zombies you create are the payoff. Make them count.*

| Card | Notes |

### RECURSION ENGINE (10)

| Aphetto Animist | Untap target artifact; use to reactivate sacrifice outlets. |
| Command Beacon | Return commander to hand from command zone — avoids commander tax. |

---

## KEY COMBINATIONS & TRIGGER CHAINS

**The Main Loop:**
1. Cast Nevinyrral → ETB destroys all non-Zombie creatures (say, 15 creatures)
2. Sacrifice Nevinyrral to Ashnod's Altar (2 mana) or let it die to anything
3. Death trigger: create 15 Zombie tokens (×2 with Doubling Season = 30)
4. Blood Artist/Zulaport drains opponents 15–30 life from deaths
5. Syr Konrad pings 1 damage per death = 15+ damage
6. Use 2 mana from Altar + Nim Deathmantle trigger (pay 4, net: need 2 more from elsewhere): Nevinyrral returns equipped
7. Repeat — but now you have 30 Zombies so ETB only kills non-Zombies (opponents' creatures)

**The Mikaeus Line:**
1. Cast Nevinyrral → ETB wipes
2. Nevinyrral dies → Undying returns him with +1/+1 → ETB wipes again
3. Nevinyrral dies again (no undying counter now) → Death trigger fires twice → Double Zombie army
4. Use Altar of Dementia to mill yourself → fill graveyard → Animate Dead Nevinyrral → do it all again

**The Forbidden Orchard Pre-Fill:**
1. Early game: tap Forbidden Orchard repeatedly for colorless mana, giving opponents 1/1 Spirits
2. Opponents also playing creatures naturally
3. Cast Nevinyrral when opponents have 8–10+ creatures: ETB destroys them all
4. Death trigger creates 8–10 Zombies, doubled if Doubling Season is out

**Turns 1–5:** Ramp. Establish death trigger payoffs (Blood Artist, Syr Konrad, Zulaport). Tap Forbidden Orchard to donate Spirits to opponents. Play patient.

**Turns 6–7:** Cast Nevinyrral (7 mana). ETB wipes 8–15 creatures. Immediately sacrifice him to Ashnod's Altar. Death trigger creates proportional Zombie army. Drain triggers from Blood Artist/Zulaport fire.

**Turns 7+:** Recurse Nevinyrral via Reanimate (1 mana), Animate Dead, or Nim Deathmantle loop. Each loop wipes non-Zombies, creates Zombies, drains opponents. After 3 loops, opponents are topdecking with no board while you have 20+ Zombies and 60–80 life drained from them.

# DECK 4: BREYA, ETHERIUM SHAPER
## "Infinite Machines"
### Commander: Breya, Etherium Shaper (Yore-Tiller — W/U/B/R)
### Strategy: Artifact Token Creation | Activated Ability Spam | Mana Cost Reduction | Infinite Combo Engine

---

## COMMANDER OVERVIEW

**Breya, Etherium Shaper** (WUBR, Legendary Artifact Creature — Human Artificer)
- When Breya enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 blue Thopter artifact creature tokens with flying.
- Pay 2, sacrifice two artifacts: choose one —
  - Deal 3 damage to any target
  - Target player loses 3 life and you gain 3 life
  - Target artifact gains +5/+5 until end of turn
  - Destroy target artifact or enchantment

The strategy: reduce the cost of Breya's activated ability to 0 (or near 0), create infinite artifact tokens, and activate her ability infinite times for infinite damage, drain, or removal. Cost reduction is the engine. Token creation is the fuel. Activated abilities are the win condition.

## THE 99

### COMMANDER (1)
- Breya, Etherium Shaper

---

### COST REDUCTION PACKAGE (14)
*Reduce the 2-mana activation cost of Breya's ability as close to 0 as possible.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Krark-Clan Ironworks | Sacrifice an artifact: add 2 colorless mana. Sacrificing to Breya's cost IS sacrificing an artifact. KCI makes Breya's ability self-funding. |
| Ashnod's Altar | Sacrifice a creature for 2 colorless. Sacrificing artifact creatures to pay for Breya's ability nets 0 mana if you have 2 artifacts. KCI is strictly better but stacks. |
| Phyrexian Altar | Sacrifice for any color. More flexible for colored costs. |
| Semblance Anvil | Exile an artifact: artifacts of that type cost 2 less. If you exile a token, all tokens cost 2 less — Breya's tokens enter, you pay 2 activation cost at 0 if you have 2 tokens. |
| Etherium Sculptor | All artifact spells cost 1 less. Reduces Breya's recast cost. |
| Foundry Inspector | Same as Etherium Sculptor. Stack for 2-mana reduction. |
| Cloud Key | Name artifact: all artifact spells cost 1 less. Third reduction piece. |
| Helm of Awakening | All spells cost 1 less. Symmetrical but you benefit most. |
| Mycosynth Golem | All artifact creature spells gain affinity for artifacts. Breya costs less based on artifacts you control. |
| Jhoira's Familiar | Historic spells (artifacts, legendaries, sagas) cost 1 less. |
| Urza, Lord High Artificer | Tap any artifact: add 1 blue. Converts tokens to mana directly. |
| Goblin Welder | Sacrifice an artifact: return target artifact from graveyard. Free sacrifice with upside. |
| Daretti, Scrap Savant | +2: loot (draw/discard); -2: reanimate an artifact. |
| Second Sunrise | All artifacts that went to graveyard this turn return. Mass recursion after sacrificing. |

---

### TOKEN CREATION ENGINE (16)
*Create artifact tokens to feed Breya's ability and maintain sacrificial fodder.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Breya's own ETB | Creates 2 Thopters each time she enters. Blink her repeatedly. |
| Thopter Foundry | Sacrifice an artifact: create a 1/1 Thopter + gain 1 life. Infinite combo piece. |
| Sword of the Meek | Returns from graveyard whenever a 1/1 creature enters. Loops with Thopter Foundry. |
| Myr Battlesphere | ETB: four 1/1 Myr tokens. Attack: tap Myrs for damage. |
| Efficient Construction | Whenever you cast an artifact spell: 1/1 Thopter token. Passive token engine. |
| Sharding Sphinx | Whenever an artifact creature deals combat damage: 1/1 Thopter. Exponential growth. |
| Hangarback Walker | Dies → Thopters equal to its +1/+1 counters. |
| Walking Ballista | Versatile artifact; can grow and ping. Infinite damage piece. |
| Servo Exhibition | Two 1/1 Servo tokens for 2 mana. Cheap fodder. |
| Master of Etherium | +1/+1 to artifact creatures; its power/toughness = artifacts you control. Lord + finisher. |
| Whirler Rogue | ETB: two 1/1 Thopters. Tap 2 Thopters: target creature unblockable. |
| Faerie Artisans | Whenever a nontoken creature ETB under an opponent's control: copy it as artifact token. |
| Saheeli Rai | +1: Scry 1, deal 1; -2: Copy target artifact or creature as a token (it's an artifact). |
| Saheeli, the Gifted | +1: Create a 1/1 Servo; -2: Next artifact spell costs X less where X = artifacts you control. |
| Sai, Master Thopterist | Cast an artifact: 1/1 Thopter. Tap 2 artifacts: draw and discard. |
| Brudiclad, Telchor Engineer | Create a 2/1 Myr token each combat; turn all tokens into copies of one of your tokens. Turn all tokens into Breya copies? Yes. |

---

### COMBO PACKAGE (8 key combo pieces)
*Identify the infinite combos and include the pieces.*

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Thopter Foundry + Sword of the Meek | Sacrifice Sword to Foundry: 1/1 Thopter + gain 1 life. Sword returns (1/1 entered). Repeat with 1 mana: infinite Thopters + infinite life. With Ashnod's Altar: infinite mana too. |
| Krark-Clan Ironworks + any token generator | Generate tokens, sacrifice to KCI for mana, use mana to cast Breya repeatedly, each Breya cast makes Thopters, sacrifice those for more mana — loops. |

---

### KEY SYNERGY TOOLS (8)

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Arcbound Ravager | Sacrifice artifact: put +1/+1 counter on Ravager. Mass modular distribution. |
| Disciple of the Vault | Whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard: opponents lose 1 life. Each sacrifice = drain. Combine with infinite loop = infinite drain. |
| Sharuum the Hegemon | ETB: return target artifact from graveyard. Combo with Sculpting Steel/Phyrexian Metamorph for infinite ETB triggers. |
| Marionette Master | Choose fabricate 3 (three 1/1 tokens) or +1/+1 counters; whenever artifact goes to graveyard: opponents lose life equal to its power. |
| Cranial Plating | Attach to Breya or a token: +1/+1 for each artifact you control. Enormous buff. |
| Darksteel Forge | All your artifacts are indestructible. Protect your engine from board wipes. |
| Unwinding Clock | Each player's untap step: untap all artifacts you control. Effectively gives each artifact pseudo-vigilance. |

---

### DRAW & TUTOR (8)

| Card | Notes |
|------|-------|

| Reshape | Sacrifice artifact: tutor artifact of same or lesser CMC to battlefield. |
| Fabricate | Tutor any artifact to hand. |
| Transmute Artifact | Sacrifice artifact: tutor artifact of any CMC to battlefield. Powerful. |
| Thoughtcast | Affinity for artifacts: often costs 1U with 4+ artifacts. Draw 2. |
| Thirst for Knowledge | Draw 3, discard 2 (or 1 if you discard an artifact). Efficient in artifact decks. |
| Skullclamp | 1/1 tokens equip and die immediately (0 toughness): draw 2 per token death. |

---

### INTERACTION (8)

## KEY BREYA INFINITE COMBOS (SUMMARY)

**Combo A — Zero-Cost Breya Loop (Nim Deathmantle + Ashnod's Altar):**
1. Control Breya + Nim Deathmantle + Ashnod's Altar.
2. Sacrifice Breya + one Thopter to Ashnod's Altar: 4 colorless mana.
3. Deathmantle triggers (Breya died): pay 4 mana to return Breya equipped.
4. Breya ETB: 2 Thopters created. Net mana: 0 (used all 4 for Deathmantle).
5. But: you can sacrifice those Thopters to Breya's ability for 3 damage × ∞ = infinite damage.

**Combo B — Training Grounds + KCI (Zero-Cost Activation Loop):**
1. Training Grounds on board (Breya's ability costs 0 instead of 2).
2. KCI on board (sacrifice artifact: +2 colorless).
3. Create any artifact token. Sacrifice 2 tokens to KCI: 4 mana.
4. Use 0 mana to activate Breya (pay 0, sacrifice 2 more tokens): drain 3 life from target.
5. Net mana: +4 from KCI, +0 from Breya activations. Infinite activations with infinite tokens = infinite drain.

**Combo C — Thopter Foundry + Sword of the Meek + KCI:**
1. Sacrifice Sword to Foundry: pay 1, create 1/1 Thopter.
2. Sword returns immediately (1/1 creature entered).
3. Sacrifice Sword again, repeat.
4. With KCI: sacrifice Thopters from step 1 for mana → pay for next loop.
5. Infinite Thopters + infinite life + mana → Breya pings opponents infinitely with damage activation.

---

## GAME PLAN

**Turns 1–3:** Deploy mana rocks and cost reducers. Etherium Sculptor + Foundry Inspector drop on turns 2–3 to make Breya cost WUBR instead of 1WUBR (and with rock fixing, she drops Turn 3 consistently).

**Turns 3–4:** Cast Breya (ETB: 2 Thopters). If Training Grounds or KCI is out, begin activating her immediately. Each activation costs 0 with Training Grounds; sacrificed tokens are replaced by Efficient Construction, Sai, and Sharding Sphinx.

**Turns 4–6:** Establish your combo. The Thopter Foundry + Sword of the Meek package is most consistent. Assemble pieces via Whir of Invention or Reshape.

**Win:** Infinite drain via Breya's second ability (target player loses 3 life, you gain 3) activated infinitely, or infinite damage via Walking Ballista with infinite mana, or swing with an infinite army of Thopters.

# 5. DECK-BUILDING PHILOSOPHY & NOTES

## Budget Alternatives

All four decks as written are optimized for competitive or high-power EDH (cEDH-adjacent). Budget substitutions:

| Original Card | Budget Replacement |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Timetwister | Echo of Eons |
| Underground Sea / Tropical Island (etc.) | Respective shock lands |
| Gaea's Cradle | Itlimoc, Cradle of the Sun |
| Mox Diamond | Fellwar Stone |
| Mana Crypt | Sol Ring (you already have one) |
| Imperial Seal | Vampiric Tutor |
| Vampiric Tutor | Scheming Symmetry |
| Dual lands | Appropriate shock or check lands |

## Power Level Guide

| Deck | Power Level (1–10) | cEDH? |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Xyris | 8 | Near-cEDH; fast combos |
| Varina | 7 | High power; not quite cEDH |
| Nevinyrral | 7 | High power; slower combo |
| Breya | 9–10 | cEDH; multiple infinite combos |

## Upgrade Paths

**Xyris** → Add Hullbreacher to replace opponents' draws with treasures (if your playgroup allows), or Narset, Parter of Veils to shut off opponent draws while you wheel.

**Varina** → Add Gravecrawler + Phyrexian Altar + Wayward Servant for a clean infinite drain combo. Also consider The Scarab God as an alternate commander that can recur key threats.

**Nevinyrral** → Add Dualcaster Mage + Ghostly Flicker for an infinite ETB loop. Add more blink effects (Conjurer's Closet, Soulherder) for Nevinyrral's ETB.

**Breya** → Already near-optimized. Add Auriok Salvagers + Lion's Eye Diamond for a white-mana-positive loop that wins with Walking Ballista. Add Doomsday for an alternative win line.

## FINAL NOTES

Each of these four decks operates on a different core loop, but all four share a common philosophy: **identify the engine, protect the engine, and run the engine until opponents run out of answers.**

- **Xyris** wins by making card draw a weapon — every draw opponents take fuels your board.
- **Varina** wins by making death irrelevant — your graveyard is a resource, not a loss.
- **Nevinyrral** wins by making destruction exponential — every creature killed becomes a soldier for your army.
- **Breya** wins by making cost irrelevant — 0-mana infinite loops end games before opponents stabilize.

All four are designed for four-player Commander. In lower-player games, adjust threat assessment accordingly — decks like Breya that go infinite quickly should lower their threat profile early, while Nevinyrral's slower build-up can afford to be more open.
