## 1. INTRODUCTION & HOW TO PLAY

**Dominion** is a paper-and-pencil strategy game for 1–6 players inspired by the Civilization series of video games. Over the course of a campaign (2–6 hours depending on player count and map size), players build factions from small city-states into sprawling empires, research technologies, conduct diplomacy, wage war, and race toward one of five possible victory conditions.

Everything you need to play fits on a few sheets of paper, a pencil, and a set of dice. No apps. No internet. No batteries.

### Core Philosophy

- **Asymmetric factions:** Every civilization plays differently.
- **Emergent stories:** The game generates history as it's played.
- **Simple rules, deep strategy:** The d20 system keeps resolution fast and intuitive.
- **Scalable scope:** Play a single era in 90 minutes, or run a full multi-session campaign.

### Player Counts

| Players | Recommended Map | Estimated Time |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Small (8x8) | 60–90 min |
| 2 | Medium (10x10) | 90–120 min |
| 3–4 | Large (12x12) | 2–4 hours |
| 5–6 | Epic (14x14) | 4–6 hours |

---

## 2. WHAT YOU NEED

### Required
- **Pencils and erasers** (one per player)
- **Graph paper** (at least 2 sheets per player; more for larger maps)
- **One d20** per player (or share one)
- **One d6** per player (for certain event tables)
- **Faction Record Sheets** (see Section 16 or copy the template)
- **A world map sheet** (shared, drawn during setup)

### Optional but Helpful
- Colored pencils or markers (one color per faction, for territories)
- Index cards (for technology cards and event cards)
- A ruler (for measuring map distances)
- A timer (for simultaneous turn play with larger groups)

### No Miniatures Required
Units are tracked on paper using symbols. A legend is provided in Section 10.

## 3. WORLD BUILDING & MAP CREATION

The world is built collaboratively at the start of each game. This takes 15–30 minutes and is part of the fun.

### Step 1: Choose Map Size

Draw a grid on your shared map sheet:

| Size | Grid | Max Players | Cities per Player (start) |
|------|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Small | 8x8 | 2 | 1 |
| Medium | 10x10 | 3 | 1 |
| Large | 12x12 | 4 | 1–2 |
| Epic | 14x14 | 6 | 1–2 |

Label columns A–N and rows 1–14 (or as far as needed). Each square is called a **hex** (even though it's a square — it's a tradition). One hex = approximately 100 square miles of territory.

### Step 2: Generate Terrain

Players take turns rolling d20 and consulting the **Terrain Table** to place terrain features. Each player places terrain for (grid total ÷ players) hexes, rounded up.

**Terrain Table (roll d20):**

| Roll | Terrain | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1–3 | Plains | +1 Food per turn when worked |
| 4–5 | Forest | +1 Production; blocks line of sight |
| 6–7 | Hills | +1 Production; +2 Defense bonus |
| 8–9 | Mountains | Impassable (unless tech unlocked); +3 Defense |
| 10–11 | River | +1 Food; cities on rivers get +1 Trade |
| 12–13 | Desert | No bonuses; oil discovered on nat-20 Exploration |
| 14–15 | Tundra | -1 Food; +1 Production (mining) |
| 16–17 | Jungle | +1 Food; movement costs 2 instead of 1 |
| 18–19 | Coast | +1 Trade; required for naval units |
| 20 | Special | Roll on Special Features Table |

**Special Features Table (d20):**

| Roll | Feature | Benefit |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1–4 | Ancient Ruins | First faction to explore: +2 Technology Points |
| 5–7 | Natural Harbor | +2 Trade when city built adjacent |
| 8–10 | Fertile Valley | +2 Food; very rare |
| 11–13 | Iron Deposit | +2 Production; required for Iron-tier units |
| 14–15 | Gold Vein | +2 Gold per turn when worked |
| 16–17 | Sacred Site | +2 Culture; religious wonders built here cost -2 Production |
| 18–19 | Strategic Pass | Whoever controls it: all units move through mountains freely |
| 20 | Legendary Site | GM/group decides: something unique and powerful |

### Step 3: Place Starting Positions

Each player rolls d20 and adds it to a second d20 roll. The player with the highest combined total picks their starting hex first, then descending order. Starting hexes must be on Plains, Hills, Forest, or River terrain, and must be at least 3 hexes away from any other starting position.

Place a small circle with your faction's initial letter on your starting hex. This is your **Capital City**. Record it on your Faction Record Sheet.

### Step 4: Name the World

As a group, name the world, the major geographic features (mountain ranges, seas, deserts), and any named rivers or forests. This is purely narrative but makes the game feel alive.

---

## 4. FACTION BUILDING

Each player creates a unique civilization using the following steps. Spend 10–15 minutes on this before the game begins.

### Step 1: Name Your Civilization

Choose a name, an adjective (used in play: "the *Imperial* Arenari"), and a founding myth (one sentence). Example: *The Arenari — "Children of the Red Sands." Founded when the Sun-Queen walked out of the desert and declared the first city.*

### Step 2: Choose Your Faction Type

Each faction type provides a passive bonus that defines your playstyle.

**MILITARY STATE**
Your armies are disciplined and feared.
- Passive: All military units gain +2 to Attack rolls.
- Passive: Garrison units in cities cost 1 less Production.
- Weakness: Culture generation is halved (rounded down).
- Special Ability: **Total War** — Once per game, declare Total War. For 3 turns, all your units gain +4 Attack and +2 Defense. All diplomacy with the target faction is broken permanently.

**MERCANTILE REPUBLIC**
Your traders span continents.
- Passive: All Trade income is increased by 2 per active Trade Route.
- Passive: Cities in your empire start with +1 Trade bonus.
- Weakness: Military units cost 1 more Production to build.
- Special Ability: **Market Dominance** — Once per game, flood one foreign city's market. Target city's Trade income is reduced by 3 for 4 turns. Requires an active Trade Route with that city.

**CULTURAL EMPIRE**
Your art, philosophy, and faith reshape the world.
- Passive: Culture Points generated per turn are doubled.
- Passive: You may attempt Cultural Conversion on adjacent enemy cities (see Diplomacy).
- Weakness: Gold income is reduced by 1 per city.
- Special Ability: **Golden Age** — Once per game, declare a Golden Age. For 5 turns, all cities generate double Culture and +1 Gold.

**SCIENTIFIC FEDERATION**
Your scholars push the boundaries of the possible.
- Passive: All Technology costs are reduced by 2.
- Passive: You begin the game with one free Technology.
- Weakness: Military units have -1 to all combat rolls.
- Special Ability: **Breakthrough** — Once per game, immediately research any one Technology you have the prerequisites for, for free.

**THEOCRATIC DOMINION**
Your priests and prophets rule in the name of the divine.
- Passive: All cities generate +1 Culture and +1 Gold per Holy Site controlled.
- Passive: Units defending a city adjacent to a Holy Site gain +3 Defense.
- Weakness: Diplomacy rolls with non-religious factions suffer -2.
- Special Ability: **Divine Mandate** — Once per game, declare a Crusade or Jihad. All military units gain +3 to all combat rolls for 4 turns. Units lost in this period do not reduce your Morale.

**NOMADIC CONFEDERACY**
You claim the open world, not the cities.
- Passive: All units have +1 Movement.
- Passive: You do not need to build roads — your units ignore movement penalties in all terrain.
- Passive: You may build Camps instead of Cities (see City Building).
- Weakness: You cannot build Wonders.
- Special Ability: **The Great Migration** — Once per game, move your entire civilization (all cities/camps and units) up to 3 hexes in one direction simultaneously. Enemy units in the path are pushed back.

### Step 3: Choose Faction Traits (Pick 2)

In addition to your Faction Type, choose two Traits that further customize your civilization. Each Trait gives a bonus and a minor drawback.

| Trait | Bonus | Drawback |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Seafarers** | +2 to all naval combat; coastal cities +1 Trade | Cannot build cavalry units |
| **Mountainborn** | Units ignore mountain movement penalties | -1 Food in all cities |
| **Slave Economy** | Production costs reduced by 1 in all cities | -2 to all Diplomacy rolls permanently |
| **Enlightened** | +1 Technology Point per turn | All military units cost +1 more Gold per turn upkeep |
| **Expansionist** | Settling a new city costs 2 fewer Production | New cities start with -1 Happiness |
| **Fortifiers** | City walls cost 1 fewer Production to build; +2 Defense per wall | Units cannot move more than 5 hexes from nearest city |
| **Spies** | You have one free Spy unit at game start | Diplomacy agreements last 1 turn fewer |
| **Agrarian** | All Plains and River hexes generate +1 extra Food | No bonus Production from Forest hexes |
| **Industrious** | All Production costs reduced by 1 (min 1) | Food generation reduced by 1 per city |
| **Zealots** | Units near Holy Sites gain +2 to all combat rolls | Cannot form permanent alliances |

### Step 4: Choose Starting Resources

All factions begin with:
- **Food:** 5
- **Production:** 5
- **Gold:** 5
- **Culture Points:** 0
- **Technology Points:** 0
- **Happiness:** 5
- **Military Units:** 1 Warrior
- **Cities:** 1 (Capital, founded on starting hex)

Faction Type may modify these starting values (see above).

### Step 5: Choose a Leader (Optional, for flavor)

Name your leader and assign them one of the following Leader Traits, which applies once per game:

| Leader Trait | Effect (once per game) |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Conqueror** | Win one battle automatically (before rolling) |
| **Diplomat** | Force any faction to accept a peace treaty (they can refuse war for 3 turns) |
| **Builder** | Construct one building or Wonder in one turn regardless of Production cost |
| **Visionary** | Immediately gain 5 Technology Points |
| **Merchant Prince** | Gain 10 Gold immediately |
| **Prophet** | Convert one city (any faction) to your religion without a roll |

---

## 5. THE TURN STRUCTURE

Each round of play represents approximately **25 years** of in-game time (one **Era**). A standard game lasts 20–40 rounds (500–1,000 in-game years).

### The Turn Sequence (every round, in order):

**Phase 1: World Events**
The active player (rotates each round) draws or rolls on the World Events table (Section 12). The event affects all players unless otherwise noted.

**Phase 2: Resource Collection**
All players simultaneously count and record their resources for this turn:
- Total Food from worked hexes and buildings
- Total Production from worked hexes and buildings
- Total Gold from Trade Routes and buildings
- Total Culture Points from buildings and worked hexes
- Total Technology Points from buildings and worked hexes

**Phase 3: Growth & Spending**
All players simultaneously spend resources:
- Feed your population (cities require Food equal to their Population level)
- Construct buildings or units (spend Production)
- Research technologies (spend Technology Points)
- Pay unit upkeep (each military unit costs 1 Gold per turn)

**Phase 4: Movement**
Starting with the player who has the highest Military Score (total military units x average attack), players move their units one at a time. Each unit has a Movement value (listed in Section 10).

**Phase 5: Combat**
All combat is resolved in the order it was declared during Phase 4. See Section 11 for full combat rules.

**Phase 6: Diplomacy**
Players may negotiate treaties, trade agreements, alliances, or declarations of war. All diplomatic agreements must be written on paper and signed by both parties.

**Phase 7: Culture & Conversion**
Cultural Empires and Theocratic Dominions may attempt Cultural Conversion of adjacent cities during this phase.

**Phase 8: End of Turn**
- Check Victory Conditions (Section 14)
- Advance the Era counter by 1
- Pass the "active player" marker to the left

## 6. RESOURCES & ECONOMY

### The Five Resources

**FOOD**
Food feeds your population. Each city has a Population Level (1–5). A city of Population 2 requires 2 Food per turn. If a city cannot be fed, it loses 1 Population Level and 1 Happiness. If it hits Population 0, the city is abandoned.

Food is generated by:
- Plains hexes (1 Food each, when worked)
- River hexes (1 Food each)
- Jungle hexes (1 Food)
- Farms (building, +2 Food)
- Granary (building, +1 Food, food surplus carries over)

**PRODUCTION**
Production is spent to build buildings, units, and wonders. Unspent Production does not carry over (unless you build a Stockpile — a Level 2 building).

Production is generated by:
- Forest hexes (1 Production each)
- Hills hexes (1 Production each)
- Iron Deposits (+2 Production)
- Workshop (building, +2 Production)
- Factory (building, +3 Production, requires Workshop)

**GOLD**
Gold pays for unit upkeep, bribes, diplomacy, and emergency purchases. If you run negative Gold, units begin to disband (your choice of which, 1 per turn until Gold is positive again).

Gold is generated by:
- Trade Routes (variable, see below)
- Markets (building, +2 Gold)
- Gold Veins (+2 Gold per turn)
- Ports (building, +1 Gold per coastal hex worked)

**CULTURE POINTS (CP)**
Culture Points unlock Social Policies (passive bonuses) and can be used for Cultural Conversion. Culture Points accumulate across turns — you spend from your total bank.

Culture is generated by:
- Monuments (building, +2 CP)
- Temples (building, +2 CP)
- Libraries (building, +1 CP)
- Sacred Sites (+2 CP)
- Worked by Cultural Empire faction (+double)

**Technology Points (TP)**
Technology Points are spent to research new technologies. They accumulate across turns.

Technology Points are generated by:
- Libraries (building, +2 TP)
- Universities (building, +3 TP, requires Library)
- Scientific Federation faction (+1 TP per turn)
- Ancient Ruins (one-time +2 TP when explored)

### Trade Routes

Trade Routes generate Gold and sometimes other resources. To establish a Trade Route:
1. You must have a Road or Port connecting two cities (yours or another faction's).
2. Declare the Trade Route during Phase 6 (Diplomacy).
3. Both cities must be at Population 2 or higher.
4. Roll d20 + your city's Trade bonus vs. DC 10. On success, the Trade Route is established.

**Trade Route Income:**
- Domestic route (two of your cities): +2 Gold per turn
- Foreign route (another faction's city): +3 Gold per turn (split: you get +2, they get +1 unless negotiated otherwise)
- Coastal/Naval route: +1 additional Gold

Trade Routes are broken if: war is declared between the two factions, a city is razed, or a Trade Embargo is diplomatically enacted.

### Resource Scarcity & Surplus

If any resource hits 0 (except by choice), apply the following:

| Resource at 0 | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Food | Cities begin losing Population (1 level per turn) |
| Production | No building or unit construction this turn |
| Gold | Units begin to disband (1 per turn, owner's choice) |
| Happiness below 0 | Civil Unrest: -2 to all rolls this turn; chance of rebellion (DC 14 or one city revolts) |

---

## 7. CITY BUILDING & DEVELOPMENT

### Founding a New City

To found a new city (beyond your Capital):
1. Move a **Settler** unit (see Section 10) to a valid hex (not Mountain, not within 3 hexes of another city).
2. During Phase 3, spend 5 Production and 3 Food.
3. The Settler is consumed. A new city is founded. Name it. Record it.

New cities start at **Population 1** and can work the hex they occupy plus adjacent hexes (up to Population level).

**Nomadic Confederacy** builds **Camps** instead of cities. Camps are identical to cities but can be moved 1 hex per turn as a free action. Camps cannot build Wonders or Walls but build units at -1 Production cost.

### City Population

Cities grow when Food surplus (Food collected – Food consumed) accumulates. Track the surplus on your Faction Sheet.

| Population Level | Food Required to Grow | Hexes Worked | Max Buildings |
|------------------|-----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 10 | 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 20 | 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 35 | 4 | 8 |
| 5 (max) | 55 | 5 | 10 |

### Buildings

Buildings are constructed by spending Production. Each building takes **1 turn** to construct unless otherwise noted (spending the Production in Phase 3; it's ready at the start of the next turn).

**Tier 1 Buildings (No prerequisites):**

| Building | Cost | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| Farm | 3 Prod | +2 Food per turn |
| Granary | 4 Prod | +1 Food; food surplus carries over between turns |
| Monument | 3 Prod | +2 Culture Points per turn |
| Barracks | 5 Prod | Military units built here cost -1 Production; units start with +1 Attack |
| Market | 4 Prod | +2 Gold per turn |
| Library | 5 Prod | +2 Technology Points per turn; +1 Culture Point |
| Walls | 6 Prod | City Defense +4; attackers must breach before occupying |
| Workshop | 4 Prod | +2 Production per turn |
| Temple | 4 Prod | +2 Culture Points; +1 Happiness |
| Harbor | 5 Prod | Unlocks naval units; +1 Trade per coastal hex; requires coastal hex |

**Tier 2 Buildings (Requires matching Tier 1):**

| Building | Requires | Cost | Effect |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| Aqueduct | Granary | 6 Prod | +2 Food; city immune to Plague event |
| Forge | Workshop | 6 Prod | +3 Production; Iron units cost -1 Production |
| University | Library | 8 Prod | +3 Technology Points per turn |
| Bank | Market | 7 Prod | +3 Gold; Trade Routes generate +1 additional Gold |
| Colosseum | Monument | 7 Prod | +3 Happiness; +1 Culture |
| Castle | Walls | 8 Prod | City Defense +6 (replaces Walls bonus); Walls must exist first |
| Courthouse | Any Tier 1 | 6 Prod | Occupied cities have -2 unrest; +1 Happiness |
| Arsenal | Barracks | 8 Prod | All units built here gain +2 Attack AND +1 Defense |
| Cathedral | Temple | 8 Prod | +3 Culture; +2 Happiness; required for Religious Wonder |
| Shipyard | Harbor | 8 Prod | Naval units cost -2 Production; +1 naval combat bonus |

### Wonders of the World

Wonders are unique global buildings — only one of each can exist in the entire game. The first faction to complete a Wonder gains its benefit; all others lose any Production invested in the same Wonder.

**Building a Wonder:** Announce your intent to build a Wonder at the start of Phase 3. Spend the listed Production cost over multiple turns (track cumulative progress on your sheet). The Wonder is completed when total invested Production equals the cost.

If another faction completes the Wonder first (they announce completion), you lose all invested Production. No refunds. This is civilization.

| Wonder | Cost | Effect | Requirement |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| The Great Wall | 20 Prod | All your cities gain +5 Defense; enemy units entering your territory have -1 Movement | Walls in 2 cities |
| The Colossus | 18 Prod | +2 Trade to ALL your cities; Trade Routes never broken by war | Harbor in capital |
| The Oracle | 15 Prod | Gain 10 Technology Points immediately; your faction sees all other factions' Technology trees | Library in capital |
| The Hanging Gardens | 16 Prod | All your cities gain +2 Food and +1 Happiness permanently | Aqueduct |
| The Pyramids | 22 Prod | All your cities' Tier 1 buildings are built in half turns (round up) | 3 cities |
| The Great Library | 20 Prod | You gain a free copy of every Technology any other player researches for the rest of the game | University |
| The Colosseum | 18 Prod | +2 Happiness in all cities; all Culture Points generated +1 | Colosseum building (ironic) |
| Notre Dame | 20 Prod | +3 Happiness in all cities; eliminates all current Unhappiness | Cathedral |
| The Forbidden City | 24 Prod | You gain one free Social Policy per turn for 5 turns | 4 cities, Pop 3+ capital |
| Manhattan Project | 30 Prod | Unlocks Nuclear Weapon (see Combat) | Factory + University |

---

## 8. TECHNOLOGY & ADVANCEMENT

Technology is researched by spending **Technology Points (TP)**. Technologies are organized into four **Eras**: Ancient, Medieval, Industrial, and Modern. You must research all available technologies in one Era before advancing to the next (or at least 4 of 6 — the group may vote on this).

### Technology Tree

**ERA 1: ANCIENT**

| Technology | Cost | Unlocks |
|------------|------|---------|
| Agriculture | 5 TP | Farms; Food surplus carries over |
| Masonry | 5 TP | Walls; Monuments |
| Bronze Working | 6 TP | Spearman unit; Barracks |
| Sailing | 6 TP | Galley (naval); Harbor |
| Writing | 7 TP | Library; Diplomacy agreements last 2 turns longer |
| Horseback Riding | 7 TP | Horseman unit; +1 Movement for all land units |

**ERA 2: MEDIEVAL**

| Technology | Cost | Unlocks | Requires |
|------------|------|---------|----------|

| Steam Power | 14 TP | Factory; Train (moves 4 hexes on roads); Ironclad (naval) | Engineering + Guilds |
| Industrialization | 14 TP | Arsenal; Workshop becomes Factory-equivalent | Steam Power |
| Scientific Method | 15 TP | Research Lab (+4 TP/turn); all TP costs -2 | Mathematics + Theology |
| Nationalism | 12 TP | Infantry unit; all units gain +1 to Morale saves | Feudalism + Gunpowder |
| Economics | 13 TP | +3 Gold income across all cities; Bank doubles gold | Guilds + Mathematics |

**ERA 4: MODERN**

| Technology | Cost | Unlocks | Requires |
|------------|------|---------|----------|
| Flight | 16 TP | Fighter (aerial unit); Bomber (aerial) | Industrialization |
| Electricity | 15 TP | +2 Production in all cities with Factory | Steam Power + Scientific Method |
| Plastics | 16 TP | Infantry +2 Attack; all unit costs -1 Production | Scientific Method + Economics |
| Nuclear Fission | 20 TP | Nuclear Weapon (requires Manhattan Project Wonder) | Scientific Method + Electricity |
| Computers | 18 TP | Spy unit (improved); Cyber attack (remove 1 enemy building per use, once per 3 turns) | Electricity + Economics |
| Space Program | 25 TP | Required for Science Victory | Computers + Flight + Nuclear Fission |

### Social Policies

Spending **Culture Points** unlocks Social Policies — passive bonuses that shape your civilization's identity. Each policy costs **15 CP**. You may have a maximum of 6 Social Policies active at once (unless you built the Forbidden City Wonder).

**Tradition:** +1 Food and +1 Production in your Capital. Capital grows 50% faster.
**Liberty:** Founding new cities costs 2 fewer Production. Settlers move +1 hex.
**Honor:** Military units gain +1 Attack. Gain 1 Gold per military unit victory.
**Piety:** Temples and Cathedrals cost -2 Production. Holy Sites generate +3 CP.
**Commerce:** Trade Routes generate +2 Gold each. Gold income never goes below 0 (deficit absorbed by policy).
**Rationalism:** Technology Points per turn +2. Scientific Method researched at -3 TP.
**Autocracy:** Units gain +2 Attack in enemy territory. Total War lasts 5 turns instead of 3.
**Freedom:** +2 Happiness in all cities. Cultural Conversion attempts gain +3.
**Order:** Cities under your control never rebel. Occupied cities assimilate in 2 turns instead of 4.

---

## 9. DIPLOMACY & ALLIANCES

All diplomatic agreements must be written on paper, signed by both players, and dated by Era number. Verbal agreements are not binding (and betraying written ones is a mechanical disadvantage, not just a moral one).

### Diplomatic Actions (Phase 6)

**DECLARING PEACE:** End an active war. Both factions must agree. Peace lasts a minimum of 3 turns — neither party may declare war on the other during this period.

**DECLARING WAR:** Any faction may declare war on any other at the start of Phase 4 (Movement). A declaration must be announced before moving units. Surprise attacks without declaration are legal but impose a -2 Diplomacy penalty with all non-allied factions for 5 turns.

**TRADE AGREEMENT:** Establish or modify a Trade Route. Must specify: which cities, what resources, what Gold split. Valid until war or mutual termination.

**NON-AGGRESSION PACT (NAP):** Both factions agree not to declare war for a specified number of turns (minimum 3). Breaking a NAP: the breaker suffers -3 to all Diplomacy rolls for 10 turns and loses 3 Happiness (international outrage).

**DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE:** If one allied faction is attacked, the other must join the war in their defense within 2 turns or the alliance is permanently broken. Alliances require both factions to be at peace.

**RESEARCH AGREEMENT:** Both factions spend 5 TP each. At the end of 3 turns, both factions gain 10 additional TP. Broken by war.

**OPEN BORDERS:** Both factions agree to allow unit movement through each other's territory. Units still cannot attack cities they pass through. Duration must be specified.

**TRIBUTE DEMAND:** One faction demands Gold, resources, or territory from another. The target rolls d20 + their Military Score vs. the demander's Military Score + 10. If the target rolls higher, they refuse with no penalty. If lower, refusing costs them -2 Happiness and -1 Diplomacy for 3 turns (international perception of weakness).

### Cultural Conversion

Cultural Empires and Theocratic Dominions may attempt to convert adjacent enemy cities to their culture or religion.

**Conversion Attempt (Phase 7):**
1. The city must be adjacent (within 1 hex) to one of your cities.
2. Spend 10 Culture Points.
3. Roll d20 + your Culture bonus vs. the target city's Defense bonus + 10.
4. On success: the city flips to your faction after 2 turns of cultural pressure. The original owner may spend 8 CP and roll d20 + their Culture bonus (DC 15) to resist.

A converted city generates Culture for you but retains its original buildings. Its military units are disbanded (or join your faction, at your option). The original owner loses the city and all its income.

---

## 10. MILITARY UNITS & COMBAT

### Unit Tracking System

Draw units on the map using these symbols (one symbol per hex; multiple units stack):

| Symbol | Unit Type |
|--------|-----------|
| ⚔ | Warrior / Infantry |
| 🏇 (draw a circle with W) | Horseman / Cavalry |
| ⟁ | Spearman / Pike |
| 💣 (draw an X) | Catapult / Cannon / Artillery |
| ⛵ (draw a wave) | Galley / Warship |
| ✈ (draw a V) | Fighter / Bomber |
| 👤 (draw a small dot) | Settler / Worker |
| ☩ (draw a cross) | Missionary |
| 🔍 (draw a small eye) | Spy |

Stack limit: maximum **3 units** per hex. If an enemy moves into a hex with 3 of your units, combat is automatically triggered.

### Unit Statistics

Each unit has four stats:

- **ATK (Attack):** Added to your d20 roll when attacking.
- **DEF (Defense):** Added to the DC an attacker must beat to damage you.
- **HP (Hit Points):** Damage a unit can absorb before being destroyed.
- **MOV (Movement):** Hexes the unit can move per turn.
- **COST:** Production cost to build. Requires Barracks unless noted.
- **UPKEEP:** Gold per turn to maintain the unit.

### Land Units

| Unit | Era | ATK | DEF | HP | MOV | Cost | Upkeep | Special |
|------|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|------|--------|---------|
| Warrior | Ancient | +2 | +1 | 8 | 2 | 3 Prod | 1G | Starting unit; no Barracks required |
| Spearman | Ancient | +2 | +3 | 10 | 2 | 4 Prod | 1G | +4 DEF vs. cavalry |
| Horseman | Ancient | +4 | +1 | 8 | 4 | 5 Prod | 2G | Can retreat after combat for free |
| Swordsman | Medieval | +5 | +3 | 12 | 2 | 6 Prod | 2G | Ignores 1 point of city Defense |
| Knight | Medieval | +6 | +2 | 10 | 4 | 8 Prod | 3G | +2 ATK when charging (moves before attacking same turn) |
| Catapult | Medieval | +7 | +0 | 8 | 1 | 8 Prod | 2G | Ranged: attacks from 2 hexes away; cannot move and attack same turn |
| Musketman | Industrial | +7 | +4 | 14 | 2 | 9 Prod | 2G | Negates city Wall bonus |

## 11. THE d20 COMBAT SYSTEM

### Core Combat Mechanic

All combat uses the following resolution:

**Attacker rolls d20 + ATK bonus vs. Defender's DEF DC (10 + DEF bonus)**

**Results:**
- **Roll beats DC by 5 or more (Critical Hit):** Deal 3 HP damage + special effect (see Critical Table).
- **Roll beats DC:** Deal 2 HP damage.
- **Roll meets DC exactly:** Deal 1 HP damage (glancing blow).
- **Roll falls below DC:** Miss. No damage.
- **Natural 20:** Automatic hit regardless of DC. Deal 3 HP damage.
- **Natural 1:** Automatic miss regardless of ATK. Attacker loses 1 HP (friendly fire, stumble, mishap).

### Combat Procedure

**Step 1: Declaration**
During Phase 4 (Movement), a player moves a unit into a hex containing enemy units or an enemy city. This declares combat. The moving unit is the Attacker.

**Step 2: Terrain Modifiers**
Apply terrain bonuses to the Defender's DC:

| Terrain | DEF Bonus |
|---------|-----------|
| Plains | +0 |
| Forest | +2 |
| Hills | +2 |
| Mountain | +4 (if passable) |
| River (crossing) | Attacker -2 ATK |
| City (no walls) | +3 |
| City (with walls) | +5 |
| City (with castle) | +7 |

**Step 3: Resolve Attacks**
The Attacker rolls first. Then the Defender rolls (using the same mechanic, but targeting the Attacker's DEF DC). Both sides deal damage simultaneously — a unit destroyed in the same round it attacks still attacks.

**Multiple Units:**
If multiple units are in a hex, each unit on both sides makes one attack per round. The attacker chooses which enemy unit to target. The defender may distribute their attacks freely.

**Step 4: Check for Retreat**
After each round of combat, either side may attempt to retreat:
- Roll d20 + MOV vs. DC 12.
- On success: all retreating units move 1 hex away from combat. They cannot attack this turn.
- On failure: retreat fails; units are considered Pinned and must continue fighting.
- Cavalry (Horseman, Knight) may always retreat without rolling.

**Step 5: Victory**
Combat ends when one side has no units remaining in the hex (all destroyed or retreated).
- If the Attacker wins: they occupy the hex. If the hex contained a city, see City Capture below.
- If the Defender wins: the attacking units are destroyed or retreated.
- If both sides are depleted: the hex is contested (no owner; both sides may not use it until one moves in).

### City Capture

To capture a city, an attacker must:
1. Destroy or rout all defending units in the city hex.
2. If the city has **Walls**, spend 1 additional turn of combat to breach them (the Attacker rolls d20 + ATK vs. DC 18; repeat until the walls fall; the city does not fight back during breach attempts unless garrisoned).
3. Occupy the city hex with at least 1 surviving unit.

**After capture, choose one:**
- **Occupy:** The city becomes yours at Population -1 (minimum 1). All buildings intact. City generates Unrest for 4 turns (-1 Happiness, -1 Gold). Requires a Courthouse to reduce unrest faster.
- **Raze:** The city is destroyed entirely. The hex becomes ruins (treated as Plains with -1 Food). You gain 5 Gold immediately. All factions suffer -2 Diplomacy with you for 3 turns.
- **Liberate:** Return the city to a third faction (not its original owner). You gain +4 Diplomacy with that faction and +2 Happiness globally (goodwill). The faction receiving the liberated city owes you a diplomatic favor.

### Critical Hit Table (roll d6 when a critical is scored)

| d6 | Critical Effect |
|----|----------------|
| 1 | **Rout:** Target unit loses 1 MOV for 2 turns (disorganized). |
| 2 | **Wound the Commander:** Target unit suffers -2 ATK for 3 turns. |
| 3 | **Equipment Destroyed:** Target unit loses 1 DEF permanently (unit damaged). |
| 4 | **Breakthrough:** Attacker may immediately move 1 additional hex after combat. |
| 5 | **Inspire:** One friendly adjacent unit gains +2 ATK next turn. |
| 6 | **Decisive Blow:** Deal 1 additional HP damage (total 4 HP this hit). |

### Siege Warfare

Cities can be **besieged** rather than assaulted directly. A besieging force surrounds the city (occupies all adjacent hexes or declares siege):
- Each turn of siege: the city loses 1 Food (cannot generate Food from worked hexes).
- When Food hits 0, the city's Population drops. At Population 0, the city surrenders.
- A besieged city cannot build new units but can still fight.
- Ranged units (Catapult, Cannon, Bomber) may fire into a besieged city once per turn from adjacent hexes, adding their ATK to the siege pressure.

### Morale

Each faction has a **Morale** score that starts at 10. Morale affects how long your civilization can sustain war.

**Morale drops by 1 when:**
- A city is captured or razed (-2 if it was the Capital)
- More than 3 units are destroyed in a single turn
- Happiness falls below 3

**Morale recovers by 1 when:**
- You capture an enemy city
- A turn passes with no combat
- Happiness is above 7

**Morale Effects:**

| Morale | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 8–10 | Normal |
| 5–7 | -1 to all combat rolls |
| 3–4 | -2 to all combat rolls; units may refuse to advance (DC 12 Will save or unit does not move) |
| 1–2 | -3 to all combat rolls; must sue for peace within 2 turns or faction collapses |
| 0 | Faction collapses: all units disband, cities are divided among attackers |

---

## 12. DISASTERS, EVENTS & THE WORLD DECK

At the start of each turn (Phase 1), the active player rolls d20 on the World Events table. Some events affect everyone; some target specific factions.

### World Events Table (d20)

| Roll | Event | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Earthquake** | The active player chooses one hex: all buildings in adjacent cities lose 1 tier (Tier 2 → Tier 1; Tier 1 → destroyed). |
| 2 | **Plague** | One city (active player's choice, targeting any faction) loses 1 Population. Cities with Aqueducts are immune. |
| 3 | **Famine** | All factions lose 2 Food this turn. |
| 4 | **Barbarian Raid** | Place 2 Barbarian Warriors (ATK +2, DEF +1, HP 6) in the wilderness hex furthest from all cities. They move 2 hexes toward the nearest city each turn until defeated. |
| 5 | **Civil Unrest** | The faction with the lowest Happiness loses 1 additional Happiness and must make a DC 13 roll or one city revolts (loses its garrison and generates no income for 2 turns). |
| 6 | **Drought** | All Plains and River hexes generate 0 Food this turn. |
| 7 | **Trade Windfall** | All active Trade Routes generate double Gold this turn. |
| 8 | **Great Person Born** | One faction (highest Culture score) gains a Great Person (choose: Scientist +5 TP, Artist +5 CP, General +3 to all units' ATK for 1 turn, Merchant +8 Gold). |
| 9 | **Discovery** | One faction (active player's choice) may explore an adjacent uncharted hex. Roll d20: on 15+, find a Special Feature (roll on that table). |
| 10 | **Technological Leap** | The faction with the most Libraries gains 3 bonus TP. |
| 11 | **Alliance Rumbles** | All current Alliances are tested: each allied pair must reaffirm (both agree verbally this turn) or the alliance is suspended for 1 turn. |
| 12 | **Calm** | No event. A moment of peace. Enjoy it. |
| 13 | **Calm** | No event. |
| 14 | **Resource Boom** | One terrain type (roll d6: 1-Plains, 2-Forest, 3-Hills, 4-River, 5-Coast, 6-Desert) generates +1 of its resource for all factions this turn. |
| 15 | **Religious Fervor** | All Temples and Cathedrals generate double Culture Points this turn. |
| 16 | **Naval Storm** | All naval units must roll d20 vs. DC 12 or be pushed 1 hex in a random direction. Units pushed onto land are destroyed. |
| 17 | **Espionage Exposed** | All active Spy units are revealed to their host factions. The host may immediately expel them (Spy moves back 3 hexes). |
| 18 | **Golden Harvest** | One faction (lowest Food) gains 5 bonus Food. |
| 19 | **Arms Race** | All factions gain 2 Production this turn. |
| 20 | **World Wonder Discovered** | A Legendary Site (Section 3) appears in a random unoccupied wilderness hex. The first faction to occupy it gains a free Wonder of their choice (no production cost, but they must have the prerequisites). |

### Barbarian Rules

Barbarians are uncontrolled units that appear through World Events and in unexplored wilderness. They are controlled by the following simple AI:

1. Move toward the nearest city (or unit if closer).
2. Attack any unit or city they are adjacent to.
3. They use the same d20 combat system. Their stats are always: ATK +2, DEF +1, HP 6.
4. If a Barbarian captures a city, it is razed automatically (maximum drama).
5. Defeating Barbarians: the faction that kills the last Barbarian in a group gains 2 Gold per unit killed.

---

## 13. SINGLEPLAYER MODE (AUTOMA RULES)

In singleplayer, you control one faction and face 1–3 **Automa Factions** — simplified computer-controlled civilizations that provide challenge and competition.

### Setting Up Automa

For each Automa faction:
1. Roll d6 to determine their Faction Type (1–2: Military State; 3: Mercantile; 4: Scientific; 5: Cultural; 6: Theocratic).
2. Place their Capital as usual during setup.
3. Choose an Automa Difficulty: Settler (Easy), Chieftain (Medium), King (Hard), Deity (Expert).

### Automa Turn Sequence

Each Automa faction takes a simplified turn. At the start of their Phase 3, roll d20 and consult the Automa Action Table:

| Roll | Automa Action |
|------|--------------|
| 1–3 | **Build Unit:** The Automa builds 1 military unit (type based on current Era). |
| 4–6 | **Build City:** The Automa sends a Settler to the nearest valid unclaimed hex and founds a city. |
| 7–9 | **Research:** The Automa gains 3 TP and researches the cheapest available Technology. |
| 10–12 | **Build Building:** The Automa builds the cheapest available building in their Capital. |
| 13–15 | **Expand:** All Automa units move 1 hex toward the nearest unclaimed or enemy territory. |
| 16–17 | **Fortify:** All Automa units in cities hold position; cities gain +1 DEF until next Automa turn. |
| 18–19 | **Aggress:** If the Automa has 2+ military units and any enemy is within 3 hexes, they declare war and move toward the nearest enemy city. |
| 20 | **Wonder Rush:** The Automa begins building the Wonder they are closest to completing (GM picks thematically). |

### Automa Combat

When Automa units fight, use the standard d20 system. The Automa always attacks if it can. It never retreats unless Morale hits 3 (then it retreats all units to its nearest city).

### Automa Difficulty Modifiers

| Difficulty | Bonus |
|------------|-------|
| Settler | -2 to all Automa ATK and DEF rolls |
| Chieftain | No modifier |
| King | +2 to all Automa ATK rolls; Automa starts with 1 extra city |
| Deity | +4 to all Automa ATK rolls; Automa starts with 2 extra cities and 1 free Technology |

### Victory in Singleplayer

The player wins by achieving any Victory Condition (Section 14) before the Automa does. The Automa tracks toward their own Victory Condition based on Faction Type (Military: Domination; Mercantile: Economic; Scientific: Science; Cultural: Culture; Theocratic: Religious). At the end of each turn, check if the Automa has met their victory condition.

---

## 14. WINNING THE GAME

There are five Victory Conditions. The first faction to meet any condition wins. Declare your victory at the end of a turn; all other players may dispute it (verify on paper records).

### 1. DOMINATION VICTORY
**Condition:** You control the original Capital cities of every other faction simultaneously.
Capitals recaptured by their original owner reset your progress.

### 2. SCIENCE VICTORY
**Condition:** Research the Space Program technology AND complete 3 Space Missions.
Space Missions cost 15 Production each and take 3 turns each to complete. You must have an active Space Program (University + Factory in Capital). When all 3 are complete, your civilization launches into the stars.

### 3. CULTURAL VICTORY
**Condition:** Accumulate 150 Culture Points total AND have your Culture influence spread to at least half of all cities on the map (including foreign cities).
Culture influence is spread through Cultural Conversion (Section 9) and Trade Routes.

### 4. ECONOMIC VICTORY
**Condition:** Accumulate 200 Gold in your treasury AND have active Trade Routes with every living faction.
This is the hardest victory to pull off in wartime — you need everyone to be trading with you.

### 5. RELIGIOUS VICTORY (Optional — group must agree to include at start)
**Condition:** Convert all cities on the map to your religion.
Requires Theology technology. Use Missionaries and Cultural Conversion mechanics. Cities in hostile territory are harder to convert.

### 6. DIPLOMATIC VICTORY (Optional — multiplayer only)
**Condition:** Found the United World (requires 5 Diplomacy agreements active simultaneously with different factions) and win a United World Vote.
The vote happens when one faction proposes it (costs 20 CP). Each faction votes with their Military Score as weight. The faction with the most votes (not counting their own) wins. Factions vote for their strongest ally or trade partner.

### Tiebreaker
If the game ends by Era limit (group decides a maximum Era count at game start) without a winner, final score is calculated:

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Per city controlled | 2 pts |
| Per Technology researched | 1 pt |
| Per Wonder owned | 5 pts |
| Per 10 Gold in treasury | 1 pt |
| Per 20 Culture Points accumulated | 1 pt |
| Per enemy Capital controlled | 10 pts |

Highest score wins.

## DESIGNER'S NOTES

**On Balance:** No faction is meant to be "best." Military States win wars but lose culture races. Scientific Federations snowball late but are fragile early. The game is designed so that any victory condition is achievable by any faction type — it just takes different paths.

**On Playtime:** If your game is running long, try these accelerators:
- Reduce the Era limit
- All factions start with 2 cities instead of 1
- Reduce Wonder costs by 5
- Skip the Religious Victory condition

**On Singleplayer Depth:** For a richer solo experience, run 2–3 Automa factions with distinct personalities. Give each one a name and a "goal" (the Automa that aggressively builds toward Domination creates different pressure than one racing toward Science). Narrate their history as you play.

**On Campaign Play:** For multi-session campaigns, keep your Faction Sheets between sessions. At the end of each session, record the Era count and all unit positions. Each new session begins at the World Events phase of the next turn. Campaigns of 3–5 sessions covering 600 in-game years produce remarkable emergent stories.

**On Customization:** The technology tree, building list, and unit roster are designed to be modifiable. Want to run a fantasy version? Replace Industrial Era with Arcane Era. Replace Gunpowder with Siege Magic. Replace Tanks with War Golems. The d20 resolution system works with any thematic skin you put on it.
